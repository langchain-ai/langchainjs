 *    "@sap/hana-client": "^2.17.22"    (or latest version)

        Unless the user specifies a specific number of examples they wish to obtain, always limit your query to at most {top_k} results using the LIMIT clause.
        You can order the results by a relevant column to return the most interesting examples in the database.
        Never query for all the columns from a specific table, only ask for a the few relevant columns given the question.
        You have access to tools for interacting with the database.
        Only use the below tools. Only use the information returned by the below tools to construct your final answer.
        You MUST double check your query before executing it. If you get an error while executing a query, rewrite the query and try again.
        Always use a schema name when running a query.
        
        DO NOT make any DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP etc.) to the database.
        
        If the question does not seem related to the database, just return "I don't know" as the answer.`;
