1
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,920
<i>Corruption discovered
at the core of the Banking Clan!</i>

2
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,620
<i>Reunited, Rush Clovis
and Senator Amidala</i>

3
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,830
<i>discover the full extent
of the deception.</i>

4
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,960
<i>Anakin Skywalker is sent to the rescue!</i>

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,050
<i>He refuses to trust Clovis and
asks Padm not to work with him.</i>

6
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,050
<i>Determined to save the banks,
she refuses her husband's request,</i>

7
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,800
<i>throwing their
relationship into turmoil.</i>

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,890
<i>Voted for by both the
Separatists and the Republic,</i>

9
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,260
<i>Rush Clovis is elected new leader
of the Galactic Banking Clan.</i>

10
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,320
<i>Now, all attention is focused on Scipio</i>

11
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,350
<i>as the important
transfer of power begins.</i>

12
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,330
Welcome back to Scipio, Rush Clovis.

13
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,240
Our Separatist government
has great hopes for you.

14
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,080
Thank you, Senator.

15
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,750
Only you and Senator Amidala

16
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,330
will be allowed to monitor
the exchange proceedings.

17
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,050
No forces on either side

18
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,540
will be allowed
into the Neutral Zone.

19
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,750
Senator Amidala,
we will be right here

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,850
if you should need us.

21
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,210
Thank you, Commander.

22
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,190
It is with great disappointment

23
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:13,020
that I implement
the following verdict.

24
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,490
By decree of the Muun people,

25
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,570
the five representatives
standing before me

26
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,280
are found guilty
of embezzlement.

27
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,450
They shall be imprisoned
forthwith,

28
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,660
and control of the banks
shall transfer immediately

29
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,580
to Rush Clovis

30
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,080
under the guidance
of the Muun government.

31
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,250
We are grateful to you, Clovis,

32
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,630
for everything you have done
for the Muun people.

33
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,340
To have lost the banks

34
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,010
would have been
an historic disaster.

35
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,510
I would like you to know

36
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,840
I have no interest
in controlling the banks.

37
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,930
I am simply here
to reestablish order.

38
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,060
Do you think our friend
is up to the task?

39
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,850
There are few men
I have met in my career

40
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,680
who are more dedicated
to a cause than Clovis.

41
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,850
Once he decides
what he is fighting for,

42
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,360
little will stop him
from achieving it.

43
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,520
Let us hope you are right

44
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,910
for all our sakes.

45
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,540
Ah, Clovis.

46
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,160
How are you liking
your new office?

47
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:48,040
I must say, you look very
comfortable behind that desk.

48
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,080
Count Dooku,
what do I owe the pleasure?

49
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,420
Come, come, my boy.

50
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,920
You don't think I'd let
such an important day pass

51
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,630
without wishing you
the best of luck.

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,930
Thank you, but luck
has nothing to do with it.

53
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,260
The transfer has occurred
without a hitch.

54
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,010
Well, of course it has.

55
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,430
The Separatists are fully
behind your appointment.

56
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,430
After all, aren't we the ones
who put you there?

57
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,100
For your support, I am grateful,

58
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,480
but I now must lead

59
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,270
without allegiance
towards either side.

60
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,570
Is that so?

61
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,030
Quite the idealist you have become
in so short a time.

62
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,490
What do you want, Dooku?

63
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,700
To collect on my investment.

64
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,620
How do you think the Republic
would like to know

65
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,250
that it was I
who supplied Rush Clovis

66
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,950
with all the information
he needed

67
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,030
to topple the leaders of the bank?

68
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,910
I will tell them myself.

69
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,700
Oh, but you can't.

70
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,800
I put you in power.

71
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,290
You belong to me,

72
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,120
and if you want to stay in control,

73
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,840
you will do as I say.

74
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,050
The banks will remain unbiased.

75
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,850
Then I'm afraid the Separatists

76
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,260
will be unable to pay
the interest on our loans.

77
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,300
But the banks will collapse,
and then...

78
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,840
Not if you raise
interest rates on the Republic.

79
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,970
What?

80
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,880
You know I can't do that.

81
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,600
Oh, but you can, and you will,

82
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,430
or everything that you
fought so hard for

83
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,350
will be destroyed.

84
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,860
By the new order
of the Traxus Division

85
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,240
and in an attempt
to stabilize the banks,

86
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,450
it is essential that interest
rates on loans to the Republic

87
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,910
be raised immediately.

88
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,490
What?

89
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,950
But you can't do that!

90
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,700
Clovis.

91
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,910
Clovis!

92
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,950
What are you doing?

93
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,670
This is an outrage!

94
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,920
We warned you this would happen!

95
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,260
And what of the Separatists?

96
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,760
From the little information.

97
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,550
Senator Amidala
has been able to establish,

98
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,430
there will be no raise
on their current loan.

99
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,060
I knew from the beginning
that Clovis would do this.

100
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,270
Hmm, correct you might have been

101
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,690
about Clovis.

102
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,150
It's incredibly foolish

103
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,360
for to make a move like this
so early.

104
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,440
He will turn the whole Republic
against him.

105
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,570
Not clear to us
are his objectives.

106
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,820
Want this he might.

107
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,820
Something's wrong.

108
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,450
This doesn't make sense.

109
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,950
I would like
to call for restraint

110
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,740
and allow us time
to analyze the situation.

111
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,760
You may begin your attack.

112
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,420
It is time to make Rush Clovis

113
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,800
look like a powerful Separatist.

114
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
Right away, sir.

115
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,930
It looks like
an invasion fleet, sir.

116
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,970
We're caught out here
in the open.

117
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,740
Get the men off this landing pad
and beyond the city gates!

118
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,450
Senator Amidala,
come in, please.

119
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,280
What is it, Commander Thorn?

120
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,490
We're under attack
by the Separatist garrison.

121
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,240
Looks to be a full invasion.

122
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,660
Invasion?

123
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,240
We can't get to you.

124
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,160
I suggest you get to a ship
as soon as you can.

125
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,290
Boom!

126
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,670
Ahh!

127
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,760
Let's move!

128
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,050
Hurry!

129
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,740
Ah!

130
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,280
For the Republic!

131
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,620
Ah!

132
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,180
Our garrison has been attacked
by the Separatists,

133
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,760
and it appears they are staging
an invasion of Scipio.

134
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,220
An invasion?

135
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,190
What do they hope to achieve?

136
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,860
With this news, the Senate
will vote immediately

137
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,230
to attack Scipio.

138
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,230
It appears war has already
come to Scipio.

139
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,440
I want you off that planet
immediately.

140
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,940
I can't.

141
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,270
Surely you can get to a ship.

142
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,570
General Skywalker,
I'm afraid I'm trapped.

143
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
Let me go!

144
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,700
Invoke an emergency meeting
of the Senate.

145
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,700
There is no time to lose.

146
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,240
I feel it is only right

147
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,990
that you should handle
this matter, my boy.

148
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,200
A lot will be entrusted to you.

149
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,130
Don't touch me!

150
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,920
What have you done to her?

151
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,840
Clovis, what is going on?

152
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
I didn't want this, Padm.

153
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,090
Why don't you tell her
what you did want

154
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,940
and how you got it.

155
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,260
Dooku.

156
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,720
Padm, this is not what it seems.

157
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,060
Hasn't she joined our cause?

158
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,140
Clovis here told me
how instrumental you were

159
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,350
in getting him to power.

160
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,410
If I had known...

161
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,810
Either you are with us

162
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,530
or you are against us.

163
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,740
Arrest her!

164
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,440
We can't do this, Dooku.

165
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,110
The Separatist Senate
will never approve.

166
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
Hey!

167
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,530
No. No.

168
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,620
No!

169
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,590
No!

170
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,830
Are you insane?

171
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,750
This was not part of the deal.

172
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,250
What deal?

173
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,250
What have you done here, Clovis?

174
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,250
He's given us the banks.

175
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,670
Gone are our debts,

176
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,500
and gone is any credit
for the Republic.

177
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,130
All of your idealism
was just a front.

178
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,050
There was nothing I could do.

179
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,880
Everyone has their price,
my dear.

180
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,050
It is with grave news

181
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
I come before you.

182
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,350
Count Dooku and his
Separatist betrayers

183
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,850
have manipulated us, my friends.

184
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,230
The war must go to Scipio!

185
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,900
Clovis has been
their puppet of deceit

186
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,150
as the Separatists are
currently invading Scipio.

187
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,990
We must stop them
and secure the planet!

188
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,110
We have handed
the entire economic system

189
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,030
over to Count Dooku.

190
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,700
We are doomed!

191
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,870
Invade!

192
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,450
As Supreme Chancellor,
I must abide

193
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,910
by the consensus of the Senate.

194
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,170
We shall commence
a mercy mission to Scipio

195
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,080
to be led by
General Anakin Skywalker.

196
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,890
The banks will be secured
at all costs,

197
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,170
and the Republic
will not crumble!

198
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,856
Victory!

199
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,800
We will take victory.

200
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,760
War on Scipio!

201
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,600
Great emotions
you will find on Scipio,

202
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,560
will you not?

203
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,310
I am worried
for Senator Amidala.

204
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,890
I'm afraid we may be too late.

205
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,530
Correct you were about Clovis,

206
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,190
but let go of your selfishness
you must

207
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,520
if you are to see clearly.

208
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,230
Not all is as it seems.

209
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,790
I understand, Master.

210
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,750
Lord Tyranus, the Republic fleet

211
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,300
will be arriving shortly.

212
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,970
Very good, my lord.

213
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,800
Clovis has blindly
played his part.

214
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,970
It now appears he coordinated

215
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,970
the entire Separatist takeover.

216
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,510
And because of this treachery,

217
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,640
the banks will be firmly placed

218
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,140
under the control
of the Supreme Chancellor.

219
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,440
Why are you doing this?

220
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,990
You wouldn't understand.

221
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,860
I had to strike a deal
with Dooku,

222
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,860
but don't worry.

223
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,570
I am the one in control.

224
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,320
As soon as things
have settled down,

225
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,240
I can get rid of him,
and I'll control it all again.

226
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,450
Listen to yourself.

227
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,260
The Republic is sending
its armada

228
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,040
to take back the banks.

229
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,710
You've brought war
right where there cannot be war.

230
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,330
Your actions
have destroyed the banks

231
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,220
once and for all!

232
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,680
Rex, have you gotten a fix
on Senator Amidala's position?

233
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,390
We'll have a better lock
once we get near the city,

234
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,010
but initial scans suggest
she's still alive, sir.

235
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,560
Good.

236
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,100
Hawk, we're gonna need
air support

237
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,220
once we're on the ground.

238
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,430
You'll have it, General.

239
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,560
Me and the boys
are ready to fly.

240
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,670
My Lord,

241
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,040
we have fully engaged
Republic forces,

242
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,550
but we are suffering
heavy losses.

243
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,050
We have accomplished
what we came here for.

244
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,960
It is time to withdraw.

245
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:06,090
But sir, our forces
are still engaged

246
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,300
in battle on the planet.

247
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,680
Leave them.

248
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,090
As you wish, Count Dooku.

249
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,690
Sir, a Republic attack fleet
has just entered orbit

250
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,110
and is approaching the city.

251
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,780
Get me Count Dooku.

252
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,200
It appears Count Dooku
has left the planet's surface.

253
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,740
What?

254
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,700
And the Separatist forces
are in full retreat.

255
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,740
We are alone.

256
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,180
Rex, hold the droid forces here.

257
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,930
I'm gonna push on and get Padm.

258
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:21,970
Copy that.

259
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,270
Such plans I had.

260
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,660
You know, I've spent so much
of my life misunderstood.

261
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,860
What will they say about me now?

262
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,150
What will I have left behind?

263
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Clovis, you have to
turn yourself in.

264
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,620
It's over, Clovis.

265
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,300
Stay away from me!

266
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,920
I didn't do anything wrong!

267
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,630
You have to believe me!

268
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,010
You don't want to do this.

269
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,760
You don't understand.

270
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,300
You've all been deceived.

271
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,720
Yeah, by you.

272
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,890
No!

273
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:25,930
By Dooku.

274
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,070
I'm not the villain here.

275
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,310
Tell him, Padm.

276
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,640
Let me go, Clovis.

277
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,540
I can't hold both of you.

278
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,590
Let me go.

279
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,500
No, Anakin, don't.

280
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,260
Try and climb.

281
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,180
I am!

282
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,010
I'm losing you!

283
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,890
I'm sorry, Padm.

284
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,720
No.

285
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,190
It's okay.

286
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,410
You're okay.

287
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,530
I'm sorry, Anakin.

288
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,150
I'm sorry.

289
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,950
It's over now.

290
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,570
It's all over now.

291
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,200
It is clear to the Banking Clan

292
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,510
it was Rush Clovis who was
behind the corruption

293
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,960
that almost caused our collapse.

294
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,120
In hope of a better tomorrow,

295
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,790
we cede control of the banks

296
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,810
to the office of the Chancellor
of the Galactic Republic.

297
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,340
It is with great humility

298
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,680
that I take on
this immense responsibility.

299
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,010
Rest assured,
when the Clone Wars end,

300
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,060
I shall reinstate the banks

301
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,220
as we once knew them,

302
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:46,270
but during these
treacherous times,

303
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,890
we cannot in good conscience
allow our money

304
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,940
to fall under the manipulations

305
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,900
of a madman like Count Dooku

306
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,020
or Separatist control again.

307
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:04,240
May there be prosperity
and stability

308
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,320
in all our Republic lands.

309
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,070
May our people be free and safe.

310
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,240
Long live the banks!

311
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,450
<i>Long live the banks!</i>

312
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,380
<i>Long live the banks!</i>

313
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,450
<i>Long live the banks!</i>

314
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,500
<i>Long live the banks!
Long live the banks!</i>

315
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,330
<i>Long live the banks!</i>

316
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,130
<i>Long live the banks!
Long live the banks!</i>
