/**
 * `fromExistingGraph` Method:
 *
 * Description:
 * This method initializes a `Neo4jVectorStore` instance using an existing graph in the Neo4j database.
 * It's designed to work with nodes that already have textual properties but might not have embeddings.
 * The method will compute and store embeddings for nodes that lack them.
 *
 * Note:
 * This method is particularly useful when you have a pre-existing graph with textual data and you want
 * to enhance it with vector embeddings for similarity searches without altering the original data structure.
