/**
 * Access Thread-Level State in Tools
 *
 * Sometimes a tool needs the full thread state (e.g. all messages) to do its job.
 * A canonical example is delegating to a sub-agent from inside a tool: the tool
 * passes the entire message list along with a task to the sub-agent, which then
 * performs analysis or planning over the whole conversation.
 *
 * Why this is important:
 * - Sub-agent workflows: Delegate specialized work while giving full context
 * - State-aware tools: Tools can access thread state beyond the immediate input
 * - Better results: Sub-agents reason over the entire conversation, not just a single turn
 *
 * Example Scenario:
 * A supervisor agent has a `delegate_to_subagent` tool. When the user asks for a
 * conversation-wide summary or action items, the supervisor calls the tool, which
 * passes the full message history plus a task to the sub-agent. The sub-agent
 * returns a polished result back to the supervisor.

 * The conversation focused on handling a situation where someone feels overwhelmed by their workload.
 * Suggestions included prioritizing tasks, communicating openly with a manager about the workload,

 *
 * === Delegate Action Items to Sub-Agent ===
 * Here are the concrete action items from the discussion:
 *
 * 1. Schedule a meeting with the marketing team to discuss the new campaign strategy.
 * 2. Follow up with the design team to finalize the brochure layout by Friday.
 * 3. Send the updated project timeline to all team members by the end of the day.
 * 4. Confirm the venue booking for the upcoming client presentation.
