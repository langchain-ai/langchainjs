/**
 * Update Long Term Memory in Tools
 *
 * This enables tools to persist information to long-term memory stores, allowing them to contribute to the
 * agent's growing knowledge base and learned experiences.
 *
 * Why this is important:
 * - Knowledge Accumulation: Tools can contribute to the agent's learning by storing important findings and experiences
 * - Cross-Session Learning: Information gathered in one session becomes available for future interactions
 * - Continuous Improvement: Enables the agent system to become more knowledgeable and effective over time
 *
 * Example Scenario:
 * You're building a sales assistant that learns about customer preferences during conversations. When a customer
 * mentions "I prefer eco-friendly products", the tool stores this preference in long-term memory so future
 * interactions with this customer can emphasize sustainable options automatically.
