/**
 * Access External Context for Runtime Parameters
 *
 * Context contains runtime parameters like user ID, database connections, and static
 * configuration that affects how the agent behaves. This context can influence the
 * system prompt and tool behavior.
 *
 * Context vs State Distinction:
 * - Context: Static runtime parameters (user ID, DB connections, config)
 *   - Set once per session/request
 *   - Doesn't change during conversation
 *   - Used to look up user info, configure behavior
 *
 * - State: Dynamic conversation data (messages, memory, session variables)
 *   - Modified over time during interaction
 *   - Persists and evolves through the conversation
 *   - Managed by the agent framework
 *
 * Example Scenario:
 * A support agent that needs the current user's ID to look up their account details
 * and tailor responses. The user ID is static context, but the conversation messages
 * are dynamic state.
