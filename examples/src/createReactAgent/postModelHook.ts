/**
 * Post Model Hook
 *
 * The post-model hook runs AFTER the model generates a response, allowing for post-processing, validation,
 * human-in-the-loop approval, and modification of the model's output before it reaches the user.
 *
 * Why this is important:
 * - Quality assurance layer independent of prompt engineering
 * - Enforces safety/compliance policies consistently across all outputs
 * - Enables observable, auditable response transformations (easy to test/log)
 * - Provides a single place to tune business rules without touching tools
 *
 * When to use:
 * - You need guardrails on every response (family-friendly, brand voice, legal)
 * - You want deterministic checks (no extra model calls) before delivery
 * - You must gate certain categories (legal/medical/financial) for human review
 * - You want to aggregate metrics on moderation and quality improvements
