/**
 * Custom System Prompts
 *
 * System prompts can be customized by populating templates with variables from
 * external context, state, or memory. You create a template string and fill in
 * the variables when creating the agent.
 *
 * The variables can come from:
 * - External context (user info, session data, app state)
 * - Thread state (conversation history, inferred preferences)
 * - Long-term memory (stored user data, past interactions)
 *
 * Example Scenario:
 * A customer service agent needs to know the user's account tier, support history,
 * and current product context to provide appropriate assistance.
