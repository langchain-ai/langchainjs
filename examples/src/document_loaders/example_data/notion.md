‚ö° Building applications with LLMs through composability ‚ö°

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.
Please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/57d8AmXBYp8PP8tZA) and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`yarn add langchain`

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";
```

## ü§î What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling
developers to build applications that they previously could not.
But using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to
create a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications.

## Relationship with Python LangChain

This is built to integrate as seamlessly as possible with the [LangChain Python package](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain). Specifically, this means all objects (prompts, LLMs, chains, etc) are designed in a way where they can be serialized and shared between languages.

The [LangChainHub](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain-hub) is a central place for the serialized versions of these prompts, chains, and agents.
