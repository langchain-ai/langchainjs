He also mentioned that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will continue Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence, and that the constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade—standing precedent for half a century—is under attack as never before. He emphasized the importance of protecting access to health care, preserving a woman's right to choose, and advancing maternal health care in America. He also expressed his support for the LGBTQ+ community, and his commitment to protecting their rights, including offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation to beat the opioid epidemic, increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery, and strengthen the Violence Against Women Act."
