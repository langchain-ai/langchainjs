# Wrangler configuration for @langchain/core v1 Cloudflare Workers tests
#
# @langchain/core uses dynamic imports with graceful fallback for node:async_hooks.
# This allows it to run in Cloudflare Workers WITHOUT the nodejs_compat flag.
#
# Note: Context propagation features will use a mock implementation
# in environments without node:async_hooks.
