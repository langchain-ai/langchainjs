# Summarization

:::info
[Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/use-cases/summarization)
:::

A common use case is wanting to summarize long documents.
This naturally runs into the context window limitations.
Unlike in question-answering, you can't just do some semantic search hacks to only select the chunks of text most relevant to the question (because, in this case, there is no particular question - you want to summarize everything).
So what do you do then?

To get started, we would recommend checking out the summarization chain which attacks this problem in a recursive manner.
