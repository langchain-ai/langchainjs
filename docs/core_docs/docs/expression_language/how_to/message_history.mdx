# Add message history (memory)

The `RunnableWithMessageHistory` let's us add message history to certain types of chains.

Specifically, it can be used for any Runnable that takes as input one of

- a sequence of `BaseMessage`
- a dict with a key that takes a sequence of `BaseMessage`
- a dict with a key that takes the latest message(s) as a string or sequence of `BaseMessage`, and a separate key that takes historical messages

And returns as output one of

- a string that can be treated as the contents of an `AIMessage`
- a sequence of `BaseMessage`
- a dict with a key that contains a sequence of `BaseMessage`

Let's take a look at some examples to see how it works.

## Setup

We'll use Upstash to store our chat message histories and Anthropic's claude-2 model so we'll need to install the following dependencies:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/anthropic @langchain/community @upstash/redis
```

You'll need to set environment variables for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and grab your Upstash REST url and secret token.

### [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/)

LangSmith is especially useful for something like message history injection, where it can be hard to otherwise understand what the inputs are to various parts of the chain.

Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful.
If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to uncoment the below and set your environment variables to start logging traces:

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="<your-api-key>"
```

## Example: Dict input, message output

Let's create a simple chain that takes a dict as input and returns a BaseMessage.

In this case the `"question"` key in the input represents our input message, and the `"history"` key is where our historical messages will be injected.

```typescript
import {
  ChatPromptTemplate,
  MessagesPlaceholder,
} from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { ChatAnthropic } from "@langchain/anthropic";
import { UpstashRedisChatMessageHistory } from "@langchain/community/stores/message/upstash_redis";
// For demos, you can also use an in-memory store:
// import { ChatMessageHistory } from "langchain/stores/message/in_memory";

const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  ["system", "You're an assistant who's good at {ability}"],
  new MessagesPlaceholder("history"),
  ["human", "{question}"],
]);

const chain = prompt.pipe(new ChatAnthropic({ modelName: "claude-2.1" }));
```

### Adding message history

To add message history to our original chain we wrap it in the `RunnableWithMessageHistory` class.

Crucially, we also need to define a method that takes a `sessionId` string and based on it returns a `BaseChatMessageHistory`. Given the same input, this method should return an equivalent output.

In this case we'll also want to specify `inputMessagesKey` (the key to be treated as the latest input message) and `historyMessagesKey` (the key to add historical messages to).

```typescript
const chainWithHistory = new RunnableWithMessageHistory({
  runnable: chain,
  getMessageHistory: (sessionId) =>
    new UpstashRedisChatMessageHistory({
      sessionId,
      config: {
        url: process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL!,
        token: process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN!,
      },
    }),
  inputMessagesKey: "question",
  historyMessagesKey: "history",
});
```

## Invoking with config

Whenever we call our chain with message history, we need to include an additional config object that contains the `session_id`

```typescript
{
  configurable: {
    sessionId: "<SESSION_ID>";
  }
}
```

Given the same configuration, our chain should be pulling from the same chat message history.

```typescript
const result = await chainWithHistory.invoke(
  {
    ability: "math",
    question: "What does cosine mean?",
  },
  {
    configurable: {
      sessionId: "foobarbaz",
    },
  }
);

console.log(result);

Looking at the Langsmith trace for the second call, we can see that when constructing the prompt, a "history" variable has been injected which is a list of two messages (our first input and first output).
