# RAG

Let's now look at adding in a retrieval step to a prompt and an LLM, which adds up to a "retrieval-augmented generation" chain:

## Conversational Retrieval Chain

Because `RunnableSequence.from` and `runnable.pipe` both accept runnable-like objects, including single-argument functions, we can add in conversation history via a formatting function.
This allows us to recreate the popular `ConversationalRetrievalQAChain` to "chat with data":

Note that the individual chains we created are themselves `Runnables` and can therefore be piped into each other.
