# Interface

In an effort to make it as easy as possible to create custom chains, we've implemented a ["Runnable"](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/schema_runnable.Runnable.html) protocol that most components implement.
This is a standard interface with a few different methods, which make it easy to define custom chains as well as making it possible to invoke them in a standard way. The standard interface exposed includes:

- `stream`: stream back chunks of the response
- `invoke`: call the chain on an input
- `batch`: call the chain on a list of inputs

The **input type** varies by component :

| Component      | Input Type                                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Prompt         | Object                                              |
| Retriever      | Single string                                       |
| LLM, ChatModel | Single string, list of chat messages or PromptValue |
| Tool           | Single string, or object, depending on the tool     |
| OutputParser   | The output of an LLM or ChatModel                   |

The **output type** also varies by component :

| Component    | Output Type           |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| LLM          | String                |
| ChatModel    | ChatMessage           |
| Prompt       | PromptValue           |
| Retriever    | List of documents     |
| Tool         | Depends on the tool   |
| OutputParser | Depends on the parser |

You can combine runnables (and runnable-like objects such as functions and objects whose values are all functions) into sequences in two ways:

- Call the `.pipe` instance method, which takes another runnable-like as an argument
- Use the `RunnableSequence.from([])` static method with an array of runnable-likes, which will run in sequence when invoked

See below for examples of how this looks.

## Stream

import StreamExample from "@examples/guides/expression_language/interface_stream.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StreamExample}</CodeBlock>

## Invoke

import InvokeExample from "@examples/guides/expression_language/interface_invoke.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{InvokeExample}</CodeBlock>

## Batch

import BatchExample from "@examples/guides/expression_language/interface_batch.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{BatchExample}</CodeBlock>

You can also pass a `batchOptions` argument to the call. There are options to set maximum concurrency
and whether or not to return exceptions instead of throwing them (useful for gracefully handling failures!):

import BatchExampleWithOptions from "@examples/guides/expression_language/interface_batch_with_options.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{BatchExampleWithOptions}</CodeBlock>
