# Get started

LCEL makes it easy to build complex chains from basic components, and supports out of the box functionality such as streaming, parallelism, and logging.

## Basic example: prompt + model + output parser

The most basic and common use case is chaining a prompt template and a model together. To see how this works, let's create a chain that takes a topic and generates a joke:

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{BasicExample}</CodeBlock>

Notice in this line we're chaining our prompt, LLM model and output parser together:

```typescript
const chain = prompt.pipe(model).pipe(outputParser);
```

The `.pipe()` method allows for chaining together any number of runnables. It will pass the output of one through to the input of the next.

Here, the prompt is passed a `topic` and when invoked it returns a formatted string with the `{topic}` input variable replaced with the string we passed to the invoke call.
That string is then passed as the input to the LLM which returns a `BaseMessage` object. Finally, the output parser takes that `BaseMessage` object and returns the content of that object as a string.

### 1. Prompt

`prompt` is a `BasePromptTemplate`, which means it takes in an object of template variables and produces a `PromptValue`.
A `PromptValue` is a wrapper around a completed prompt that can be passed to either an `LLM` (which takes a string as input) or `ChatModel` (which takes a sequence of messages as input).
It can work with either language model type because it defines logic both for producing BaseMessages and for producing a string.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{BasicPromptExample}</CodeBlock>

### 2. Model

The `PromptValue` is then passed to `model`. In this case our `model` is a `ChatModel`, meaning it will output a `BaseMessage`.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{BasicChatModelExample}</CodeBlock>

If our model was an LLM, it would output a string.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{BasicLLMModelExample}</CodeBlock>

### 3. Output parser

And lastly we pass our `model` output to the `outputParser`, which is a `BaseOutputParser` meaning it takes either a string or a `BaseMessage` as input. The `StringOutputParser` specifically simple converts any input into a string.

## RAG Search Example

For our next example, we want to run a retrieval-augmented generation chain to add some context when responding to questions.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{BasicRagExample}</CodeBlock>

In this chain we add some extra logic around retrieving context from a vector store.

We first instantiated our model, vector store and output parser. Then we defined our prompt, which takes in two input variables:

- `context` -> this is a string which is returned from our vector store based on a semantic search from the input.
- `question` -> this is the question we want to ask.

Next we created a `setupAndRetriever` runnable. This has two components which return the values required by our prompt:

- `context` -> this is a `RunnableLambda` which takes the input from the `.invoke()` call, makes a request to our vector store, and returns the first result.
- `question` -> this uses a `RunnablePassthrough` which simply passes whatever the input was through to the next step, and in our case it returns it to the key in the object we defined.

Both of these are wrapped inside a `RunnableMap`. This is a special type of runnable that takes an object of runnables and executes them all in parallel.
It then returns an object with the same keys as the input object, but with the values replaced with the output of the runnables.

Finally, we pass the output of the `setupAndRetriever` to our `prompt` and then to our `model` and `outputParser` as before.
