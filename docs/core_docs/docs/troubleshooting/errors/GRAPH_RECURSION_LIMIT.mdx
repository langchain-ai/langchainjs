# GRAPH_RECURSION_LIMIT

Your LangGraph [`StateGraph`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/classes/langgraph.StateGraph.html) reached the maximum number of steps before hitting a stop condition.
This is often due to an infinite loop caused by code like the example below:

```ts
const graph = new StateGraph(...)
  .addNode("a", ...)
  .addNode("b", ...)
  .addEdge("a", "b")
  .addEdge("b", "a")
  ...
  .compile();
```

However, complex graphs may hit the default limit naturally.

## Troubleshooting

- If you are not expecting your graph to go through many iterations, you likely have a cycle. Check your logic for infinite loops.
- If you have a complex graph, you can pass in a higher `recursionLimit` value into your `config` object when invoking your graph like this:

```ts
await graph.invoke({...}, { recursionLimit: 100 });
```
