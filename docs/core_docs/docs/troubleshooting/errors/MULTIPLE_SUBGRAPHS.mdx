# MULTIPLE_SUBGRAPHS

You are calling the same subgraph multiple times within a single LangGraph node with checkpointing enabled for each subgraph.

This is currently not allowed due to internal restrictions on how checkpoint namespacing for subgraphs works.

## Troubleshooting

The following may help resolve this error:

- If you don't need to interrupt/resume from a subgraph, pass `checkpointer=false` when compiling it like this: `.compile({ checkpointer: false })`
- Don't imperatively call graphs multiple times in the same node, and instead use the [`Send`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/classes/langgraph.Send.html) API.
