# UNREACHABLE_NODE

LangGraph cannot identify an incoming edge to one of your nodes. Check to ensure you have added sufficient edges when constructing your graph.

Alternatively, if you are returning [`Command`](/docs/how_to/command/) instances from your nodes to make your graphs edgeless, you will need to add an additional `ends` parameter when calling `addNode` to help LangGraph determine the destinations for your node.

Here's an example:

```typescript
import { Annotation, Command } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const StateAnnotation = Annotation.Root({
  foo: Annotation<string>,
});

const nodeA = async (_state: typeof StateAnnotation.State) => {
  const goto = Math.random() > 0.5 ? "nodeB" : "nodeC";
  return new Command({
    update: { foo: "a" },
    goto,
  });
};

const nodeB = async (state: typeof StateAnnotation.State) => {
  return {
    foo: state.foo + "|b",
  };
};

const nodeC = async (state: typeof StateAnnotation.State) => {
  return {
    foo: state.foo + "|c",
  };
};

import { StateGraph } from "@langchain/langgraph";

// NOTE: there are no edges between nodes A, B and C!
const graph = new StateGraph(StateAnnotation)
  .addNode("nodeA", nodeA, {
    // Explicitly specify "nodeB" and "nodeC" as potential destinations for nodeA
    ends: ["nodeB", "nodeC"],
  })
  .addNode("nodeB", nodeB)
  .addNode("nodeC", nodeC)
  .addEdge("__start__", "nodeA")
  .compile();
```

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure that you have not forgotten to add edges between some of your nodes.

- If you are returning Commands from your nodes, make sure that you're passing an ends array with the names of potential destination nodes as shown above.
