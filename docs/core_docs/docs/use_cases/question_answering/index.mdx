# QA and Chat over Documents

Chat and Question-Answering (QA) over `data` are popular LLM use-cases.

`data` can include many things, including:

- `Unstructured data` (e.g., PDFs)
- `Structured data` (e.g., SQL)
- `Code` (e.g., Python)

Below we will review Chat and QA on `Unstructured data`.

![intro.png](/img/qa_intro.png)

`Unstructured data` can be loaded from many sources.

Check out the [document loader integrations here](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/) to browse the set of supported loaders.

Each loader returns data as a LangChain `Document`.

`Documents` are turned into a Chat or QA app following the general steps below:

- `Splitting`: [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) break `Documents` into splits of specified size
- `Storage`: Storage (e.g., often a [vectorstore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/)) will house [and often embed](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-embeddings/) the splits
- `Retrieval`: The app retrieves splits from storage (e.g., often [with similar embeddings](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/k-nearest-neighbor/) to the input question)
- `Output`: An [LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/models/llms/) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved splits

## Quickstart

Let's load this [blog post](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) on agents as an example `Document`.

We'll have a QA app in a few lines of code.

First, set environment variables and install packages required for the guide:

```shell
> yarn add cheerio
# Or load env vars in your preferred way:
> export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
```

## 1. Loading, Splitting, Storage

### 1.1 Getting started

Specify a `Document` loader.

```typescript
// Document loader
import { CheerioWebBaseLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/web/cheerio";

const loader = new CheerioWebBaseLoader(
  "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/"
);
const data = await loader.load();
```

Split the `Document` into chunks for embedding and vector storage.

```typescript
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";

const textSplitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
  chunkSize: 500,
  chunkOverlap: 0,
});

const splitDocs = await textSplitter.splitDocuments(data);
```

Embed and store the splits in a vector database (for demo purposes we use an unoptimized, in-memory example but you can [browse integrations here](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/)):

```typescript
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "langchain/embeddings/openai";
import { MemoryVectorStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/memory";

const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings();

const vectorStore = await MemoryVectorStore.fromDocuments(
  splitDocs,
  embeddings
);
```

Here are the three pieces together:

### 1.2 Going Deeper

#### 1.2.1 Integrations

`Document Loaders`

- Browse document loader integrations [here](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/).

- See further documentation on loaders [here](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/).

`Document Transformers`

- All can ingest loaded `Documents` and process them (e.g., split).

- See further documentation on transformers [here](/docs/integrations/document_transformers/).

`Vectorstores`

- Browse vectorstore integrations [here](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/).

- See further documentation on vectorstores [here](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/).

## 2. Retrieval

### 2.1 Getting started

Retrieve [relevant splits](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/what-is-similarity-search/) for any question using `similarity_search`.

```typescript
const relevantDocs = await vectorStore.similaritySearch(
  "What is task decomposition?"
);

console.log(relevantDocs.length);

// 4
```

### 2.2 Going Deeper

#### 2.2.1 Retrieval

Vectorstores are commonly used for retrieval.

But, they are not the only option.

For example, SVMs (see thread [here](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1647025230546886658?s=20)) can also be used.

LangChain [has many retrievers and retrieval methods](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/) including, but not limited to, vectorstores.

All retrievers implement some common methods, such as `getRelevantDocuments()`.

## 3. QA

### 3.1 Getting started

Distill the retrieved documents into an answer using an LLM (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`) with `RetrievalQA` chain.

```typescript
import { RetrievalQAChain } from "langchain/chains";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";

const model = new ChatOpenAI({ modelName: "gpt-3.5-turbo" });
const chain = RetrievalQAChain.fromLLM(model, vectorStore.asRetriever());

const response = await chain.call({
  query: "What is task decomposition?",
});
console.log(response);

/*
  {
    text: 'Task decomposition refers to the process of breaking down a larger task into smaller, more manageable subgoals. By decomposing a task, it becomes easier for an agent or system to handle complex tasks efficiently. Task decomposition can be done through various methods such as using prompting or task-specific instructions, or through human inputs. It helps in planning and organizing the steps required to complete a task effectively.'
  }
*/
```

### 3.2 Going Deeper

#### 3.2.1 Integrations

`LLMs`

- Browse LLM integrations and further documentation [here](/docs/integrations/llms/).

#### 3.2.2 Customizing the prompt

The prompt in `RetrievalQA` chain can be customized as follows.

```typescript
import { RetrievalQAChain } from "langchain/chains";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";
import { PromptTemplate } from "langchain/prompts";

const model = new ChatOpenAI({ modelName: "gpt-3.5-turbo" });

const template = `Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.
Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer as concise as possible.
Always say "thanks for asking!" at the end of the answer.
{context}
Question: {question}
Helpful Answer:`;

const chain = RetrievalQAChain.fromLLM(model, vectorStore.asRetriever(), {
  prompt: PromptTemplate.fromTemplate(template),
});

const response = await chain.call({
  query: "What is task decomposition?",
});

console.log(response);

/*
  {
    text: 'Task decomposition is the process of breaking down a large task into smaller, more manageable subgoals. This allows for efficient handling of complex tasks and aids in planning and organizing the steps needed to achieve the overall goal. Thanks for asking!'
  }
*/
```

#### 3.2.3 Returning source documents

The full set of retrieved documents used for answer distillation can be returned using `return_source_documents=True`.

```typescript
import { RetrievalQAChain } from "langchain/chains";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";

const model = new ChatOpenAI({ modelName: "gpt-3.5-turbo" });

const chain = RetrievalQAChain.fromLLM(model, vectorStore.asRetriever(), {
  returnSourceDocuments: true,
});

const response = await chain.call({
  query: "What is task decomposition?",
});

console.log(response.sourceDocuments[0]);

/*
Document {
  pageContent: 'Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like "Steps for XYZ.\\n1.", "What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. "Write a story outline." for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.',
  metadata: [Object]
}
*/
```

#### 3.2.4 Customizing retrieved docs in the LLM prompt

Retrieved documents can be fed to an LLM for answer distillation in a few different ways.

`stuff`, `refine`, and `map-reduce` chains for passing documents to an LLM prompt are well summarized [here](/docs/modules/chains/document/).

`stuff` is commonly used because it simply "stuffs" all retrieved documents into the prompt.

The [loadQAChain](/docs/modules/chains/document/) methods are easy ways to pass documents to an LLM using these various approaches.

```typescript
import { loadQAStuffChain } from "langchain/chains";

const stuffChain = loadQAStuffChain(model);

const stuffResult = await stuffChain.call({
  input_documents: relevantDocs,
  question: "What is task decomposition?",
});

console.log(stuffResult);
/*
{
  text: 'Task decomposition is the process of breaking down a large task into smaller, more manageable subgoals or steps. This allows for efficient handling of complex tasks by focusing on one subgoal at a time. Task decomposition can be done through various methods such as using simple prompting, task-specific instructions, or human inputs.'
}
*/
```

## 4. Chat

### 4.1 Getting started

To keep chat history, we use a variant of the previous chain called a `ConversationalRetrievalQAChain`.
First, specify a `Memory buffer` to track the conversation inputs / outputs.

```typescript
import { ConversationalRetrievalQAChain } from "langchain/chains";
import { BufferMemory } from "langchain/memory";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";

const memory = new BufferMemory({
  memoryKey: "chat_history",
  returnMessages: true,
});
```

Next, we initialize and call the chain:

```typescript
const model = new ChatOpenAI({ modelName: "gpt-3.5-turbo" });
const chain = ConversationalRetrievalQAChain.fromLLM(
  model,
  vectorStore.asRetriever(),
  {
    memory,
  }
);

const result = await chain.call({
  question: "What are some of the main ideas in self-reflection?",
});
console.log(result);

/*
{
  text: 'Some main ideas in self-reflection include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '1. Iterative Improvement: Self-reflection allows autonomous agents to improve by continuously refining past action decisions and correcting mistakes.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '2. Trial and Error: Self-reflection plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable. It helps agents learn from failed trajectories and make adjustments for future actions.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '3. Constructive Criticism: Agents engage in constructive self-criticism of their big-picture behavior to identify areas for improvement.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '4. Decision and Strategy Refinement: Reflection on past decisions and strategies enables agents to refine their approach and make more informed choices.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '5. Efficiency and Optimization: Self-reflection encourages agents to be smart and efficient in their actions, aiming to complete tasks in the least number of steps.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'These ideas highlight the importance of self-reflection in enhancing performance and guiding future actions.'
}
*/
```

The `Memory buffer` has context to resolve `"it"` ("self-reflection") in the below question.

```typescript
const followupResult = await chain.call({
  question: "How does the Reflexion paper handle it?",
});
console.log(followupResult);

/*
{
  text: "The Reflexion paper introduces a framework that equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve their reasoning skills. The approach involves showing the agent two-shot examples, where each example consists of a failed trajectory and an ideal reflection on how to guide future changes in the agent's plan. These reflections are then added to the agent's working memory as context for querying a language model. The agent uses this self-reflection information to make decisions on whether to start a new trial or continue with the current plan."
}
*/
```

### 4.2 Going deeper

The [documentation](/docs/modules/chains/popular/chat_vector_db) on `ConversationalRetrievalQAChain` offers a few extensions, such as streaming and source documents.
