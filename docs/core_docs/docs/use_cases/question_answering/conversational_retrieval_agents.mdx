# Conversational Retrieval Agents

This is an agent specifically optimized for doing retrieval when necessary while holding a conversation and being able
to answer questions based on previous dialogue in the conversation.

To start, we will set up the retriever we want to use, then turn it into a retriever tool. Next, we will use the high-level constructor for this type of agent.
Finally, we will walk through how to construct a conversational retrieval agent from components.

## The Retriever

To start, we need a retriever to use! The code here is mostly just example code. Feel free to use your own retriever and skip to the next section on creating a retriever tool.

```typescript
import { FaissStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/faiss";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "langchain/embeddings/openai";
import { TextLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/text";
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";

const loader = new TextLoader("state_of_the_union.txt");
const docs = await loader.load();
const splitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
  chunkSize: 1000,
  chunkOverlap: 0,
});

const texts = await splitter.splitDocuments(docs);

const vectorStore = await FaissStore.fromDocuments(
  texts,
  new OpenAIEmbeddings()
);

const retriever = vectorStore.asRetriever();
```

## Retriever Tool

Now we need to create a tool for our retriever. The main things we need to pass in are a `name` for the retriever as well as a `description`. These will both be used by the language model, so they should be informative.

```typescript
import { createRetrieverTool } from "langchain/agents/toolkits";

const tool = createRetrieverTool(retriever, {
  name: "search_state_of_union",
  description:
    "Searches and returns documents regarding the state-of-the-union.",
});
```

## Agent Constructor

Here, we will use the high level `create_conversational_retrieval_agent` API to construct the agent.
Notice that beside the list of tools, the only thing we need to pass in is a language model to use.

Under the hood, this agent is using the OpenAIFunctionsAgent, so we need to use an ChatOpenAI model.

```typescript
import { createConversationalRetrievalAgent } from "langchain/agents/toolkits";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";

const model = new ChatOpenAI({
  temperature: 0,
});

const executor = await createConversationalRetrievalAgent(model, [tool], {
  verbose: true,
});
```

We can now try it out!

```typescript
const result = await executor.invoke({
  input: "Hi, I'm Bob!",
});

console.log(result);

/*
  {
    output: 'Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?',
    intermediateSteps: []
  }
*/

const result2 = await executor.invoke({
  input: "What's my name?",
});

console.log(result2);

/*
  { output: 'Your name is Bob.', intermediateSteps: [] }
*/

const result3 = await executor.invoke({
  input:
    "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson in the most recent state of the union?",
});

console.log(result3);

/*
  {
    output: "In the most recent state of the union, President Biden mentioned Ketanji Brown Jackson. He nominated her as a Circuit Court of Appeals judge and described her as one of the nation's top legal minds who will continue Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence. He mentioned that she has received a broad range of support, including from the Fraternal Order of Police and former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.",
    intermediateSteps: [
      {...}
    ]
  }
*/

const result4 = await executor.invoke({
  input: "How long ago did he nominate her?",
});

console.log(result4);

/*
  {
    output: 'President Biden nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson four days before the most recent state of the union address.',
    intermediateSteps: []
  }
*/
```

Note that for the final call, the agent used previously retrieved information to answer the query and did not need to call the tool again!

Here's a trace showing how the agent fetches documents to answer the question with the retrieval tool:

## Creating from components

What actually is going on underneath the hood? Let's take a look so we can understand how to modify things going forward.

### Memory

In this example, we want the agent to remember not only previous conversations, but also previous intermediate steps.
For that, we can use `OpenAIAgentTokenBufferMemory`. Note that if you want to change whether the agent remembers intermediate steps,
how the long the retained buffer is, or anything like that you should change this part.

```typescript
import { OpenAIAgentTokenBufferMemory } from "langchain/agents/toolkits";

const memory = new OpenAIAgentTokenBufferMemory({
  llm: model,
  memoryKey: "chat_history",
  outputKey: "output",
});
```

You should make sure `memoryKey` is set to `"chat_history"` and `outputKey` is set to `"output"` for the OpenAI functions agent.
This memory also has `returnMessages` set to `true` by default.

You can also load messages from prior conversations into this memory by initializing it with a pre-loaded chat history:

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";
import { OpenAIAgentTokenBufferMemory } from "langchain/agents/toolkits";
import { HumanMessage, AIMessage } from "langchain/schema";
import { ChatMessageHistory } from "langchain/memory";

const previousMessages = [
  new HumanMessage("My name is Bob"),
  new AIMessage("Nice to meet you, Bob!"),
];

const chatHistory = new ChatMessageHistory(previousMessages);

const memory = new OpenAIAgentTokenBufferMemory({
  llm: new ChatOpenAI({}),
  memoryKey: "chat_history",
  outputKey: "output",
  chatHistory,
});
```

### Agent executor

We can recreate the agent executor directly with the `initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions` method.
This allows us to customize the agent's system message by passing in a `prefix` into `agentArgs`.
Importantly, we must pass in `return_intermediate_steps: true` since we are recording that with our memory object.

```typescript
import { initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions } from "langchain/agents";

const executor = await initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions(tools, llm, {
  agentType: "openai-functions",
  memory,
  returnIntermediateSteps: true,
  agentArgs: {
    prefix:
      prefix ??
      `Do your best to answer the questions. Feel free to use any tools available to look up relevant information, only if necessary.`,
  },
});
```
