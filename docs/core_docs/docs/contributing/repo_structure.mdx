# Repository Structure

If you plan on contributing to LangChain code or documentation, it can be useful
to understand the high level structure of the repository.

LangChain is organized as a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) that contains multiple packages.

Here's the structure visualized as a tree:

```text
.
├── docs
│   ├── core_docs # Contains content for the documentation here: https://js.langchain.com/
│   ├── api_refs # Contains content for the API refs here: https://v02.api.js.langchain.com/
├── langchain # Main package
│   ├── src/**/tests/*.test.ts/ # Unit tests (present in each package not shown for brevity)
│   ├── src/**/tests/*.int.test.ts/ # Integration tests (present in each package not shown for brevity)
├── langchain # Base interfaces for key abstractions
├── libs # Community packages
│   ├── langchain-community # Third-party integrations
│   ├── langchain-partner-1
│   ├── langchain-partner-2
│   ├── ...
```

The root directory also contains the following files:

- `package.json`: Dependencies for building docs and linting docs.

There are other files in the root directory level, but their presence should be self-explanatory. Feel free to browse around!

## Documentation

The `/docs` directory contains the content for the documentation that is shown
at https://js.langchain.com/ and the associated API Reference https://v02.api.js.langchain.com/

See the [documentation](/docs/contributing/documentation/style_guide) guidelines to learn how to contribute to the documentation.

## Code

The `/libs` directory contains the code for the LangChain packages.

To learn more about how to contribute code see the following guidelines:

- [Code](./code.mdx) Learn how to develop in the LangChain codebase.
- [Integrations](./integrations.mdx) to learn how to contribute to third-party integrations to langchain-community or to start a new partner package.
- [Testing](./testing.mdx) guidelines to learn how to write tests for the packages.
