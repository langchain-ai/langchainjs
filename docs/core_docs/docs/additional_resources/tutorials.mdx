## Deeplearning.ai

We've partnered with [Deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai) and [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng)
on a LangChain.js short course.

It covers LCEL and other building blocks you can combine to build more complex chains, as well as fundamentals around
loading data for retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Try it for free below:

- [Build LLM Apps with LangChain.js](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/build-llm-apps-with-langchain-js)

## Scrimba interactive guides

[Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) is a code-learning platform that allows you to interactively edit and run
code while watching a video walkthrough.

We've partnered with Scrimba on course materials (called "scrims") that teach the fundamentals of building with LangChain.js -
check them out below, and check back for more as they become available!

### Learn LangChain.js
