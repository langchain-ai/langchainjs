# Agents

By themselves, language models can't take actions - they just output text. Agents are systems that take a high-level task and use an LLM as a reasoning engine to decide what actions to take and execute those actions.

[LangGraph](/docs/concepts/architecture#langgraph) is an extension of LangChain specifically aimed at creating highly controllable and customizable agents. We recommend that you use LangGraph for building agents.

Please see the following resources for more information:

- LangGraph docs on [common agent architectures](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/agentic_concepts/)
- [Pre-built agents in LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/functions/langgraph_prebuilt.createReactAgent.html)
