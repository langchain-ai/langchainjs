# Conceptual guide

This guide provides explanations of the key concepts behind the LangChain framework and AI applications more broadly.

We recommend that you go through at least one of the [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials) before diving into the conceptual guide. This will provide practical context that will make it easier to understand the concepts discussed here.

The conceptual guide does not cover step-by-step instructions or specific implementation examples â€” those are found in the [How-to guides](/docs/how_to/) and [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials). For detailed reference material, please see the [API reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/).

## High level

- **[Why LangChain?](/docs/concepts/why_langchain)**: Overview of the value that LangChain provides.
- **[Architecture](/docs/concepts/architecture)**: How packages are organized in the LangChain ecosystem.

## Concepts

- **[Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)**: LLMs exposed via a chat API that process sequences of messages as input and output a message.
- **[Messages](/docs/concepts/messages)**: The unit of communication in chat models, used to represent model input and output.
- **[Chat history](/docs/concepts/chat_history)**: A conversation represented as a sequence of messages, alternating between user messages and model responses.
- **[Tools](/docs/concepts/tools)**: A function with an associated schema defining the function's name, description, and the arguments it accepts.
- **[Tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling)**: A type of chat model API that accepts tool schemas, along with messages, as input and returns invocations of those tools as part of the output message.
- **[Structured output](/docs/concepts/structured_outputs)**: A technique to make a chat model respond in a structured format, such as JSON that matches a given schema.
- **[Memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/memory/)**: Information about a conversation that is persisted so that it can be used in future conversations.
- **[Multimodality](/docs/concepts/multimodality)**: The ability to work with data that comes in different forms, such as text, audio, images, and video.
- **[Runnable interface](/docs/concepts/runnables)**: The base abstraction that many LangChain components and the LangChain Expression Language are built on.
- **[Streaming](/docs/concepts/streaming)**: LangChain streaming APIs for surfacing results as they are generated.
- **[LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/concepts/lcel)**: A syntax for orchestrating LangChain components. Most useful for simpler applications.
- **[Document loaders](/docs/concepts/document_loaders)**: Load a source as a list of documents.
- **[Retrieval](/docs/concepts/retrieval)**: Information retrieval systems can retrieve structured or unstructured data from a datasource in response to a query.
- **[Text splitters](/docs/concepts/text_splitters)**: Split long text into smaller chunks that can be individually indexed to enable granular retrieval.
- **[Embedding models](/docs/concepts/embedding_models)**: Models that represent data such as text or images in a vector space.
- **[Vector stores](/docs/concepts/vectorstores)**: Storage of and efficient search over vectors and associated metadata.
- **[Retriever](/docs/concepts/retrievers)**: A component that returns relevant documents from a knowledge base in response to a query.
- **[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](/docs/concepts/rag)**: A technique that enhances language models by combining them with external knowledge bases.
- **[Agents](/docs/concepts/agents)**: Use a [language model](/docs/concepts/chat_models) to choose a sequence of actions to take. Agents can interact with external resources via [tool](/docs/concepts/tools).
- **[Prompt templates](/docs/concepts/prompt_templates)**: Component for factoring out the static parts of a model "prompt" (usually a sequence of messages). Useful for serializing, versioning, and reusing these static parts.
- **[Output parsers](/docs/concepts/output_parsers)**: Responsible for taking the output of a model and transforming it into a more suitable format for downstream tasks. Output parsers were primarily useful prior to the general availability of [tool calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling) and [structured outputs](/docs/concepts/structured_outputs).
- **[Few-shot prompting](/docs/concepts/few_shot_prompting)**: A technique for improving model performance by providing a few examples of the task to perform in the prompt.
- **[Example selectors](/docs/concepts/example_selectors)**: Used to select the most relevant examples from a dataset based on a given input. Example selectors are used in few-shot prompting to select examples for a prompt.
- **[Callbacks](/docs/concepts/callbacks)**: Callbacks enable the execution of custom auxiliary code in built-in components. Callbacks are used to stream outputs from LLMs in LangChain, trace the intermediate steps of an application, and more.
- **[Tracing](/docs/concepts/tracing)**: The process of recording the steps that an application takes to go from input to output. Tracing is essential for debugging and diagnosing issues in complex applications.
- **[Evaluation](/docs/concepts/evaluation)**: The process of assessing the performance and effectiveness of AI applications. This involves testing the model's responses against a set of predefined criteria or benchmarks to ensure it meets the desired quality standards and fulfills the intended purpose. This process is vital for building reliable applications.
