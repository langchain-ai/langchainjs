# Custom agent

This notebook goes through how to create your own custom agent.

In this example, we will use OpenAI Function Calling to create this agent.
**This is generally the most reliable way to create agents.**

We will first create it WITHOUT memory, but we will then show how to add memory in.
Memory is needed to enable conversation.

## Load the LLM

First, let's load the language model we're going to use to control the agent.

```ts
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

/**
 * Define your chat model to use.
 */
const model = new ChatOpenAI({
  modelName: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  temperature: 0,
});
```

## Define Tools

Next, let's define some tools to use.
Let's write a really simple JavaScript function to calculate the length of a word that is passed in.

```ts
import { DynamicTool } from "langchain/tools";

const customTool = new DynamicTool({
  name: "get_word_length",
  description: "Returns the length of a word.",
  func: async (input: string) => input.length.toString(),
});

/** Define your list of tools. */
const tools = [customTool];
```

## Create Prompt

Now let us create the prompt.
Because OpenAI Function Calling is finetuned for tool usage, we hardly need any instructions on how to reason, or how to output format.
We will just have two input variables: `input` and `agent_scratchpad`. `input` should be a string containing the user objective.
`agent_scratchpad` should be a sequence of messages that contains the previous agent tool invocations and the corresponding tool outputs.

```ts
import {
  ChatPromptTemplate,
  MessagesPlaceholder,
} from "@langchain/core/prompts";

const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  ["system", "You are very powerful assistant, but don't know current events"],
  ["human", "{input}"],
  new MessagesPlaceholder("agent_scratchpad"),
]);
```

## Bind tools to LLM

How does the agent know what tools it can use?
In this case we're relying on OpenAI function calling LLMs, which take functions as a separate argument and have been specifically trained to know when to invoke those functions.

To pass in our tools to the agent, we just need to format them to the OpenAI function format and pass them to our model.
(By `bind`-ing the functions, we're making sure that they're passed in each time the model is invoked.)

```ts
import { formatToOpenAIFunction } from "langchain/tools";

const modelWithFunctions = model.bind({
  functions: tools.map((tool) => formatToOpenAIFunction(tool)),
});
```

## Create the Agent

Putting those pieces together, we can now create the agent.
We will import two last utility functions: a component for formatting intermediate steps to input messages that can be sent to the model,
and an output parser for converting the output message into an agent action/agent finish.

```ts
import { RunnableSequence } from "@langchain/core/runnables";
import { AgentExecutor, type AgentStep } from "langchain/agents";

import { formatToOpenAIFunctionMessages } from "langchain/agents/format_scratchpad";
import { OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser } from "langchain/agents/openai/output_parser";

const runnableAgent = RunnableSequence.from([
  {
    input: (i: { input: string; steps: AgentStep[] }) => i.input,
    agent_scratchpad: (i: { input: string; steps: AgentStep[] }) =>
      formatToOpenAIFunctionMessages(i.steps),
  },
  prompt,
  modelWithFunctions,
  new OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser(),
]);

const executor = AgentExecutor.fromAgentAndTools({
  agent: runnableAgent,
  tools,
});
```

And now, let's call the executor:

```ts
const input = "How many letters in the word educa?";
console.log(`Calling agent executor with query: ${input}`);

const result = await executor.invoke({
  input,
});

console.log(result);
/*
  Loaded agent executor
  Calling agent executor with query: What is the weather in New York?
  {
    input: 'How many letters in the word educa?',
    output: 'There are 5 letters in the word "educa".'
  }
*/
```

## Adding memory

This is great - we have an agent!
However, this agent is stateless - it doesn't remember anything about previous interactions.
This means you can't ask follow up questions easily.
Let's fix that by adding in memory.

In order to do this, we need to do two things:

1. Add a place for memory variables to go in the prompt
2. Keep track of the chat history

First, let's add a place for memory in the prompt.
We do this by adding a placeholder for messages with the key `"chat_history"`.
Notice that we put this ABOVE the new user input (to follow the conversation flow).

```ts
const MEMORY_KEY = "chat_history";
const memoryPrompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  [
    "system",
    "You are very powerful assistant, but bad at calculating lengths of words.",
  ],
  new MessagesPlaceholder(MEMORY_KEY),
  ["user", "{input}"],
  new MessagesPlaceholder("agent_scratchpad"),
]);
```

We can then set up a list to track the chat history:

```ts
import { AIMessage, BaseMessage, HumanMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

const chatHistory: BaseMessage[] = [];
```

We can then put it all together in an agent:

```ts
const agentWithMemory = RunnableSequence.from([
  {
    input: (i) => i.input,
    agent_scratchpad: (i) => formatToOpenAIFunctionMessages(i.steps),
    chat_history: (i) => i.chat_history,
  },
  memoryPrompt,
  modelWithFunctions,
  new OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser(),
]);
/** Pass the runnable along with the tools to create the Agent Executor */
const executorWithMemory = AgentExecutor.fromAgentAndTools({
  agent: agentWithMemory,
  tools,
});
```

When running, we now need to track the inputs and outputs as chat history.

```ts
const input1 = "how many letters in the word educa?";
const result1 = await executorWithMemory.invoke({
  input: input1,
  chat_history: chatHistory,
});

console.log(result1);

/*
  {
    input: 'how many letters in the word educa?',
    chat_history: [],
    output: 'There are 5 letters in the word "educa".'
  }
*/

chatHistory.push(new HumanMessage(input1));
chatHistory.push(new AIMessage(result.output));

const result2 = await executorWithMemory.invoke({
  input: "is that a real English word?",
  chat_history: chatHistory,
});

console.log(result2);

/*
  {
    input: 'is that a real English word?',
    chat_history: [

        lc_serializable: true,

        name: undefined,
        additional_kwargs: {}
      }
    ],
    output: 'The word "educa" is not a real English word. It has 5 letters.'
  }
