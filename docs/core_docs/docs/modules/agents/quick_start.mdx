# Quick Start

To best understand the agent framework, let’s build an agent that has two tools: one to look things up online, and one to look up specific data that we’ve loaded into a index.

This will assume knowledge of [LLMs](/docs/modules/model_io) and [retrieval](/docs/modules/data_connection) so if you haven’t already explored those sections, it is recommended you do so.

## Setup: LangSmith

By definition, agents take a self-determined, input-dependent sequence of steps before returning a user-facing output. This makes debugging these systems particularly tricky, and observability particularly important.
[LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com) is especially useful for such cases.

When building with LangChain, all steps will automatically be traced in LangSmith. To set up LangSmith we just need set the following environment variables:

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="<your-api-key>"
```

## Define tools

We first need to create the tools we want to use. We will use two tools: [Tavily](https://app.tavily.com) (to search online) and then a retriever over a local index we will create.

### [Tavily](https://app.tavily.com)

We have a built-in tool in LangChain to easily use Tavily search engine as tool.
Note that this requires a Tavily API key set as an environment variable named `TAVILY_API_KEY` - they have a free tier, but if you don’t have one or don’t want to create one, you can always ignore this step.

```typescript
import { TavilySearchResults } from "@langchain/community/tools/tavily_search";

const searchTool = new TavilySearchResults();

const toolResult = await searchTool.invoke("what is the weather in SF?");

console.log(toolResult);

/*

*/
```

### Retriever

We will also create a retriever over some data of our own. For a deeper explanation of each step here, see this [section](/docs/modules/data_connection/).

```typescript
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";
import { CheerioWebBaseLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/web/cheerio";
import { MemoryVectorStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/memory";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

const loader = new CheerioWebBaseLoader(
  "https://docs.smith.langchain.com/overview"
);
const rawDocs = await loader.load();

const splitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
  chunkSize: 1000,
  chunkOverlap: 200,
});
const docs = await splitter.splitDocuments(rawDocs);

const vectorstore = await MemoryVectorStore.fromDocuments(
  docs,
  new OpenAIEmbeddings()
);
const retriever = vectorstore.asRetriever();

const retrieverResult = await retriever.getRelevantDocuments(
  "how to upload a dataset"
);
console.log(retrieverResult[0]);

/*
  Document {
    pageContent: "dataset uploading.Once we have a dataset, how can we use it to test changes to a prompt or chain? The most basic approach is to run the chain over the data points and visualize the outputs. Despite technological advancements, there still is no substitute for looking at outputs by eye. Currently, running the chain over the data points needs to be done client-side. The LangSmith client makes it easy to pull down a dataset and then run a chain over them, logging the results to a new project associated with the dataset. From there, you can review them. We've made it easy to assign feedback to runs and mark them as correct or incorrect directly in the web app, displaying aggregate statistics for each test project.We also make it easier to evaluate these runs. To that end, we've added a set of evaluators to the open-source LangChain library. These evaluators can be specified when initiating a test run and will evaluate the results once the test run completes. If we’re being honest, most of",
    metadata: {
      source: 'https://docs.smith.langchain.com/overview',
      loc: { lines: [Object] }
    }
  }
*/
```

Now that we have populated our index that we will do doing retrieval over, we can easily turn it into a tool (the format needed for an agent to properly use it):

```typescript
import { createRetrieverTool } from "langchain/agents/toolkits";

const retrieverTool = createRetrieverTool(retriever, {
  name: "langsmith_search",
  description:
    "Search for information about LangSmith. For any questions about LangSmith, you must use this tool!",
});
```

### Tools

Now that we have created both, we can create a list of tools that we will use downstream:

```typescript
const tools = [searchTool, retrieverTool];
```

## Create the agent

Now that we have defined the tools, we can create the agent. We will be using an OpenAI Functions agent - for more information on this type of agent, as well as other options, see [this guide](/docs/modules/agents/agent_types).

First, we choose the LLM we want to be guiding the agent.

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const llm = new ChatOpenAI({
  modelName: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  temperature: 0,
});
```

Next, we choose the prompt we want to use to guide the agent:

```typescript
import type { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/prompts";
import { pull } from "langchain/hub";

// Get the prompt to use - you can modify this!
// If you want to see the prompt in full, you can at:
// https://smith.langchain.com/hub/hwchase17/openai-functions-agent
const prompt = await pull<ChatPromptTemplate>(
  "hwchase17/openai-functions-agent"
);
```

Now, we can initalize the agent with the LLM, the prompt, and the tools. The agent is responsible for taking in input and deciding what actions to take.
Crucially, the Agent does not execute those actions - that is done by the AgentExecutor (next step). For more information about how to thing about these components, see our [conceptual guide](/docs/modules/agents/concepts).

```typescript
import { createOpenAIFunctionsAgent } from "langchain/agents";

const agent = await createOpenAIFunctionsAgent({
  llm,
  tools,
  prompt,
});
```

Finally, we combine the agent (the brains) with the tools inside the AgentExecutor (which will repeatedly call the agent and execute tools).
For more information about how to thing about these components, see our [conceptual guide](/docs/modules/agents/concepts).

```typescript
import { AgentExecutor } from "langchain/agents";

const agentExecutor = new AgentExecutor({
  agent,
  tools,
});
```

## Run the agent

We can now run the agent on a few queries! Note that for now, these are all stateless queries (it won’t remember previous interactions).

```typescript
const result1 = await agentExecutor.invoke({
  input: "hi!",
});

console.log(result1);
/*
  [chain/start] [1:chain:AgentExecutor] Entering Chain run with input: {
    "input": "hi!"
  }
  [chain/end] [1:chain:AgentExecutor] [1.36s] Exiting Chain run with output: {
    "output": "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
  }
  {
    input: 'hi!',
    output: 'Hello! How can I assist you today?'
  }
*/
```

```typescript
const result2 = await agentExecutor.invoke({
  input: "how can langsmith help with testing?",
});

console.log(result2);

## Adding in memory

As mentioned earlier, this agent is stateless. This means it does not remember previous interactions.
To give it memory we need to pass in previous `chat_history`.

**Note:** the input variable below needs to be called `chat_history` because of the prompt we are using. If we use a different prompt, we could change the variable name.

```typescript
const result3 = await agentExecutor.invoke({
  input: "hi! my name is cob.",
  chat_history: [],
});

console.log(result3);
/*
  {
    input: 'hi! my name is cob.',
    chat_history: [],
    output: "Hello Cob! It's nice to meet you. How can I assist you today?"
  }
*/
```

```typescript
import { HumanMessage, AIMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

const result4 = await agentExecutor.invoke({
  input: "what's my name?",
  chat_history: [
    new HumanMessage("hi! my name is cob."),
    new AIMessage("Hello Cob! How can I assist you today?"),
  ],
});

console.log(result4);
/*
  {
    input: "what's my name?",
    chat_history: [
      HumanMessage {
        content: 'hi! my name is cob.',
        additional_kwargs: {}
      },
      AIMessage {
        content: 'Hello Cob! How can I assist you today?',
        additional_kwargs: {}
      }
    ],
    output: 'Your name is Cob. How can I assist you today, Cob?'
  }
*/
```

If we want to keep track of these messages automatically, we can wrap this in a RunnableWithMessageHistory. For more information on how to use this, see [this guide](/docs/expression_language/how_to/message_history).

```typescript
import { ChatMessageHistory } from "langchain/stores/message/in_memory";
import { RunnableWithMessageHistory } from "@langchain/core/runnables";

const messageHistory = new ChatMessageHistory();

const agentWithChatHistory = new RunnableWithMessageHistory({
  runnable: agentExecutor,
  // This is needed because in most real world scenarios, a session id is needed per user.
  // It isn't really used here because we are using a simple in memory ChatMessageHistory.
  getMessageHistory: (_sessionId) => messageHistory,
  inputMessagesKey: "input",
  historyMessagesKey: "chat_history",
});

const result5 = await agentWithChatHistory.invoke(
  {
    input: "hi! i'm cob",
  },
  {
    // This is needed because in most real world scenarios, a session id is needed per user.
    // It isn't really used here because we are using a simple in memory ChatMessageHistory.
    configurable: {
      sessionId: "foo",
    },
  }
);

console.log(result5);
/*
  {
    input: "hi! i'm cob",
    chat_history: [
      HumanMessage {
        content: "hi! i'm cob",
        additional_kwargs: {}
      },
      AIMessage {
        content: 'Hello Cob! How can I assist you today?',
        additional_kwargs: {}
      }
    ],
    output: 'Hello Cob! How can I assist you today?'
  }
*/
```

```typescript
const result6 = await agentWithChatHistory.invoke(
  {
    input: "what's my name?",
  },
  {
    // This is needed because in most real world scenarios, a session id is needed per user.
    // It isn't really used here because we are using a simple in memory ChatMessageHistory.
    configurable: {
      sessionId: "foo",
    },
  }
);

console.log(result6);
/*
  {
    input: "what's my name?",
    chat_history: [
      HumanMessage {
        content: "hi! i'm cob",
        additional_kwargs: {}
      },
      AIMessage {
        content: 'Hello Cob! How can I assist you today?',
        additional_kwargs: {}
      },
      HumanMessage {
        content: "what's my name?",
        additional_kwargs: {}
      },
      AIMessage {
        content: 'Your name is Cob. How can I assist you today, Cob?',
        additional_kwargs: {}
      }
    ],
    output: 'Your name is Cob. How can I assist you today, Cob?'
  }
*/
```

## Conclusion

That’s a wrap! In this quick start we covered how to create a simple agent. Agents are a complex topic, and there’s lot to learn!
Head back to the [main agent page](/docs/modules/agents/) to find more resources on conceptual guides, different types of agents, how to create custom tools, and more!
