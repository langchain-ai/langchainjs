# Conversational

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/agents/chat_convo_with_tracing.ts";
import RunnableExample from "@examples/agents/chat_convo_with_tracing_runnable.ts";

This walkthrough demonstrates how to use an agent optimized for conversation. Other agents are often optimized for using tools to figure out the best response, which is not ideal in a conversational setting where you may want the agent to be able to chat with the user as well.

This example shows how to construct an agent using LCEL. Constructing agents this way allows for customization beyond what previous methods like using `initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions` allow.

# Using LCEL

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{RunnableExample}</CodeBlock>

# Using `initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions`

The example below covers how to create a conversational agent for a chat model. It will utilize chat specific prompts.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>
