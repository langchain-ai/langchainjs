# Retrievers

:::info
Head to [Integrations](/docs/integrations/retrievers) for documentation on built-in integrations with retrieval providers.

A retriever is an interface that returns documents given an unstructured query. It is more general than a vector store.
A retriever does not need to be able to store documents, only to return (or retrieve) it. Vector stores can be used
as the backbone of a retriever, but there are other types of retrievers as well.

## Get started

The public API of the `BaseRetriever` class in LangChain.js is as follows:

```typescript
export abstract class BaseRetriever {
  abstract getRelevantDocuments(query: string): Promise<Document[]>;
}
```

It's that simple! You can call `getRelevantDocuments` to retrieve documents relevant to a query, where "relevance" is defined by
the specific retriever object you are calling.

Of course, we also help construct what we think useful Retrievers are. The main type of Retriever in LangChain is a vector store retriever. We will focus on that here.

**Note:** Before reading, it's important to understand [what a vector store is](../vectorstores).

This example showcases question answering over documents.
We have chosen this as the example for getting started because it nicely combines a lot of different elements (Text splitters, embeddings, vectorstores) and then also shows how to use them in a chain.

Question answering over documents consists of four steps:

1. Create an index
2. Create a Retriever from that index
3. Create a question answering chain
4. Ask questions!

Each of the steps has multiple sub steps and potential configurations, but we'll go through one common flow using HNSWLib, a local vector store.
This assumes you're using Node, but you can swap in another integration if necessary.

First, install the required dependency:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">npm install -S hnswlib-node</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">yarn add hnswlib-node</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">pnpm add hnswlib-node</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can download the `state_of_the_union.txt` file [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/docs/docs/modules/state_of_the_union.txt).

import RetrievalQAExample from "@examples/chains/retrieval_qa.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{RetrievalQAExample}</CodeBlock>

Let's walk through what's happening here.

1. We first load a long text and split it into smaller documents using a text splitter.
   We then load those documents (which also embeds the documents using the passed `OpenAIEmbeddings` instance) into HNSWLib, our vector store, creating our index.

2. Though we can query the vector store directly, we convert the vector store into a retriever to return retrieved documents in the right format for the question answering chain.

3. We initialize a `RetrievalQAChain` with the `.fromLLM` method, which we'll call later in step 4.

4. We ask questions!

See the individual sections for deeper dives on specific retrievers.
