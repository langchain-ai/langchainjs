# Supabase Self Query Retriever

This example shows how to use a self query retriever with a [Supabase](https://supabase.com) vector store.

If you haven't already set up Supabase, please [follow the instructions here](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/supabase).

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/retrievers/supabase_self_query.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

You can also initialize the retriever with default search parameters that apply in
addition to the generated query:

```typescript
const selfQueryRetriever = await SelfQueryRetriever.fromLLM({
  llm,
  vectorStore,
  documentContents,
  attributeInfo,
  /**
   * We need to create a basic translator that translates the queries into a
   * filter format that the vector store can understand. We provide a basic translator
   * translator here, but you can create your own translator by extending BaseTranslator
   * abstract class. Note that the vector store needs to support filtering on the metadata
   * attributes you want to query on.
   */
  structuredQueryTranslator: new SupabaseTranslator(),
  searchParams: {
    filter: (rpc: SupabaseFilter) => rpc.filter("metadata->>type", "eq", "movie"),,
    mergeFiltersOperator: "and",
  }
});
```

See the [official docs](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/references/api/tables_views.html?highlight=operators#json-columns) for more on how to construct metadata filters.
