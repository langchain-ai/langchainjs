# Google Vertex AI

:::info Experimental
This API is new and may change in future LangChainJS versions.
:::

The `GoogleVertexAIMultimodalEmbeddings` class provides additional methods that are
parallels to the `embedDocuments()` and `embedQuery()` methods:

- `embedImage()` and `embedImageQuery()` take node `Buffer` objects that are expected to
  contain an image.
- `embedMedia()` and `embedMediaQuery()` take an object that contain a `text` string
  field, an `image` Buffer field, or both and returns a similarly constructed object
  containing the respective vectors.

**Note:** The Google Vertex AI embeddings models have different vector sizes
than OpenAI's standard model, so some vector stores may not handle them correctly.

- The `textembedding-gecko` model in `GoogleVertexAIEmbeddings` provides 768 dimensions.
- The `multimodalembedding@001` model in `GoogleVertexAIMultimodalEmbeddings` provides 1408 dimensions.

## Setup

The Vertex AI implementation is meant to be used in Node.js and not
directly in a browser, since it requires a service account to use.

Before running this code, you should make sure the Vertex AI API is
enabled for the relevant project in your Google Cloud dashboard and that you've authenticated to
Google Cloud using one of these methods:

- You are logged into an account (using `gcloud auth application-default login`)
  permitted to that project.
- You are running on a machine using a service account that is permitted
  to the project.
- You have downloaded the credentials for a service account that is permitted
  to the project and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment
  variable to the path of this file.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install google-auth-library
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example that shows how to embed image queries:

import GoogleVertexAIMultimodalExample from "@examples/models/embeddings/googlevertexai_multimodal.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{GoogleVertexAIMultimodalExample}</CodeBlock>

## Advanced usage

Here's a more advanced example that shows how to integrate these new embeddings with a LangChain vector store.

import GoogleVertexAIMultimodalAdvancedExample from "@examples/models/embeddings/googlevertexai_multimodal_advanced.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">
  {GoogleVertexAIMultimodalAdvancedExample}
</CodeBlock>
