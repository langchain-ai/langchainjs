# Debugging chains

It can be hard to debug a `Chain` object solely from its output as most `Chain` objects involve a fair amount of input prompt preprocessing and LLM output post-processing.

Setting `verbose` to `true` will print out some internal states of the `Chain` object while running it.

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";
import { ConversationChain } from "langchain/chains";

const chat = new ChatOpenAI({});
// This chain automatically initializes and uses a `BufferMemory` instance
// as well as a default prompt.
const chain = new ConversationChain({ llm: chat, verbose: true });
const res = await chain.call({ input: "What is ChatGPT?" });

console.log({ res });

You can also set this globally by setting the `LANGCHAIN_VERBOSE` environment variable to `"true"`.
