# LLM

An LLMChain is a simple chain that adds some functionality around language models. It is used widely throughout LangChain, including in other chains and agents.

An LLMChain consists of a PromptTemplate and a language model (either an LLM or chat model). It formats the prompt template using the input key values provided (and also memory key values, if available), passes the formatted string to LLM and returns the LLM output.

## Get started

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import ExampleLLM from "@examples/chains/llm_chain.ts";
import ExampleChat from "@examples/chains/llm_chain_chat.ts";
import ExampleStream from "@examples/chains/llm_chain_stream.ts";
import ExampleCancellation from "@examples/chains/llm_chain_cancellation.ts";

We can construct an LLMChain which takes user input, formats it with a PromptTemplate, and then passes the formatted response to an LLM:

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleLLM}</CodeBlock>

## Usage with Chat Models

We can also construct an LLMChain which takes user input, formats it with a PromptTemplate, and then passes the formatted response to a ChatModel:

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleChat}</CodeBlock>

## Usage in Streaming Mode

We can also construct an LLMChain which takes user input, formats it with a PromptTemplate, and then passes the formatted response to an LLM in streaming mode, which will stream back tokens as they are generated:

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleStream}</CodeBlock>

## Cancelling a running LLMChain

We can also cancel a running LLMChain by passing an AbortSignal to the `call` method:

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleCancellation}</CodeBlock>

In this example we show cancellation in streaming mode, but it works the same way in non-streaming mode.
