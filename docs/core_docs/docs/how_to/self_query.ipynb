Specifically, given any natural language query, the retriever uses an LLM to write a structured query and then applies that structured query to its underlying vector store. This allows the retriever to not only use the user-input query for semantic similarity comparison with the contents of stored documents but to also extract filters from the user query on the metadata of stored documents and to execute those filters.\n",
