# How to cancel execution

````mdx-code-block
:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [LangChain Expression Language](/docs/concepts/lcel)
- [Chains](/docs/how_to/sequence/)
- [Streaming](/docs/how_to/streaming/)

:::
````

When building longer-running chains or
[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/) agents, you may
want to interrupt execution in situations such as a user leaving your
app or submitting a new query.

[LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](../../docs/concepts/lcel)
supports aborting runnables that are in-progress via a runtime
[signal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController/signal)
option.

````mdx-code-block
:::caution Compatibility

Built-in signal support requires `@langchain/core>=0.2.20`. Please see here for a [guide on upgrading](/docs/how_to/installation/#installing-integration-packages).

:::
````

**Note:** Individual integrations like chat models or retrievers may
have missing or differing implementations for aborting execution. Signal
support as described in this guide will apply in between steps of a
chain.

To see how this works, construct a chain such as the one below that
performs [retrieval-augmented generation](../../docs/tutorials/rag). It
answers questions by first searching the web using
[Tavily](../../docs/integrations/retrievers/tavily), then passing the
results to a chat model to generate a final answer:

````mdx-code-block
import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs />
````

```typescript
// @lc-docs-hide-cell
import { ChatAnthropic } from "@langchain/anthropic";

const llm = new ChatAnthropic({
  model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
});
```


```typescript
import { TavilySearchAPIRetriever } from "@langchain/community/retrievers/tavily_search_api";
import type { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";
import { StringOutputParser } from "@langchain/core/output_parsers";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { RunnablePassthrough, RunnableSequence } from "@langchain/core/runnables";

const formatDocsAsString = (docs: Document[]) => {
  return docs.map((doc) => doc.pageContent).join("\n\n")
}

const retriever = new TavilySearchAPIRetriever({
  k: 3,
});

const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromTemplate(`
Use the following context to answer questions to the best of your ability:

<context>
{context}
</context>

Question: {question}`)

const chain = RunnableSequence.from([
  {
    context: retriever.pipe(formatDocsAsString),
    question: new RunnablePassthrough(),
  },
  prompt,
  llm,
  new StringOutputParser(),
]);
```

If you invoke it normally, you can see it returns up-to-date
information:

```typescript
await chain.invoke("what is the current weather in SF?");
```

``` text
Based on the provided context, the current weather in San Francisco is:

Temperature: 17.6°C (63.7°F)
Condition: Sunny
Wind: 14.4 km/h (8.9 mph) from WSW direction
Humidity: 74%
Cloud cover: 15%

The information indicates it's a sunny day with mild temperatures and light winds. The data appears to be from August 2, 2024, at 17:00 local time.
```

Now, let’s interrupt it early. Initialize an
[`AbortController`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController)
and pass its `signal` property into the chain execution. To illustrate
the fact that the cancellation occurs as soon as possible, set a timeout
of 100ms:

```typescript
const controller = new AbortController();

const startTimer = console.time("timer1");

setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 100);

try {
  await chain.invoke("what is the current weather in SF?", {
    signal: controller.signal,
  });
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}

console.timeEnd("timer1");
```

Error: Aborted
    at EventTarget.<anonymous> (/Users/jacoblee/langchain/langchainjs/langchain-core/dist/utils/signal.cjs:19:24)
    at [nodejs.internal.kHybridDispatch] (node:internal/event_target:825:20)
    at EventTarget.dispatchEvent (node:internal/event_target:760:26)
    at abortSignal (node:internal/abort_controller:370:10)
    at AbortController.abort (node:internal/abort_controller:392:5)
    at Timeout._onTimeout (evalmachine.<anonymous>:7:29)
    at listOnTimeout (node:internal/timers:573:17)
    at process.processTimers (node:internal/timers:514:7)
timer1: 103.204ms
```

And you can see that execution ends after just over 100ms. Looking at
[this LangSmith
trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/63c04c3b-2683-4b73-a4f7-fb12f5cb9180/r),
you can see that the model is never called.

## Streaming

You can pass a `signal` when streaming too. This gives you more control
over using a `break` statement within the `for await... of` loop to
cancel the current run, which will only trigger after final output has
already started streaming. The below example uses a `break` statement -
note the time elapsed before cancellation occurs:

```typescript
const startTimer2 = console.time("timer2");

const stream = await chain.stream("what is the current weather in SF?");

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  console.log("chunk", chunk);
  break;
}

console.timeEnd("timer2");
```

``` text
chunk 
timer2: 3.990s
```

Now compare this to using a signal. Note that you will need to wrap the
stream in a `try/catch` block:

```typescript
const controllerForStream = new AbortController();

const startTimer3 = console.time("timer3");

setTimeout(() => controllerForStream.abort(), 100);

try {
  const streamWithSignal = await chain.stream("what is the current weather in SF?", {
    signal: controllerForStream.signal
  });
  for await (const chunk of streamWithSignal) {
    console.log(chunk);
    break;
  } 
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);  
}

console.timeEnd("timer3");
```
