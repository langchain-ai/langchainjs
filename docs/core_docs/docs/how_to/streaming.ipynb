    "Streaming is critical in making applications based on LLMs feel responsive to end-users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important LangChain primitives like LLMs, parsers, prompts, retrievers, and agents implement the LangChain Runnable Interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "This interface provides two general approaches to stream content:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.stream()`: a default implementation of streaming that streams the final output from the chain.\n",
    "- `streamEvents()` and `streamLog()`: these provide a way to stream both intermediate steps and final output from the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at both approaches!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using Stream\n",
    "\n",
    "All `Runnable` objects implement a method called stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are designed to stream the final output in chunks, yielding each chunk as soon as it is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming is only possible if all steps in the program know how to process an **input stream**; i.e., process an input chunk one at a time, and yield a corresponding output chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of this processing can vary, from straightforward tasks like emitting tokens produced by an LLM, to more challenging ones like streaming parts of JSON results before the entire JSON is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best place to start exploring streaming is with the single most important components in LLM apps – the models themselves!\n",
    "\n",
    "## LLMs and Chat Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models can take several seconds to generate a complete response to a query. This is far slower than the **~200-300 ms** threshold at which an application feels responsive to an end user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key strategy to make the application feel more responsive is to show intermediate progress; e.g., to stream the output from the model token by token."
