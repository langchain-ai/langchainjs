        "There are several strategies that models can use under the hood. For some of the most popular model providers, including [Anthropic](/docs/integrations/platforms/anthropic/), [Google VertexAI](/docs/integrations/platforms/google/), [Mistral](/docs/integrations/chat/mistral/), and [OpenAI](/docs/integrations/platforms/openai/) LangChain implements a common interface that abstracts away these strategies called `.withStructuredOutput`.\n",

        "By invoking this method (and passing in [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) or a [Zod schema](https://zod.dev/)) the model will add whatever model parameters + output parsers are necessary to get back structured output matching the requested schema. If the model supports more than one way to do this (e.g., function calling vs JSON mode) - you can configure which method to use by passing into that method.\n",
