# How to cache chat model responses

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)
- [LLMs](/docs/concepts/text_llms)

:::

LangChain provides an optional caching layer for chat models. This is useful for two reasons:

It can save you money by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider, if you're often requesting the same completion multiple times.
It can speed up your application by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider.
There are two methods for caching LLM responses: **semantic caching** and **key-value caching**.

- **Key-value caching** stores responses based on exact query (LLM prompt) matches. When the same request is made again, the cached LLM response is retrieved. Key-value caching is fast, but its shortcoming is that even small changes in the prompt—such as punctuation differences or slight wording variations (e.g., _"yes"_ vs. _"yeah"_)—can cause a cache miss, leading to a fresh LLM call.
- **[Semantic caching](/docs/integrations/semantic_caching)** improves upon key-value caching by relying on the meaning of the prompt rather than exact matches. If a new LLM prompt is semantically similar to a previously cached one, the stored response is retrieved and reused, reducing LLM usage costs. A typical implementation of semantic caching involves storing prompts as embeddings and using similarity search to identify a cache hit.

This page goes over key-value caching. To use semantic caching, see [LLM Semantic Caching](/docs/integrations/semantic_caching).

NOTE: The caching integrations in LangChain do not include expiring old or unused values. Based on your use and application, you should decide if and what kind of eviction process you need to implement and implement it directly with the storage.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

// To make the caching really obvious, let's use a slower model.
const model = new ChatOpenAI({
  model: "gpt-4",
  cache: true,
});
```

## In Memory Cache

The default cache is stored in-memory. This means that if you restart your application, the cache will be cleared.

```typescript
console.time();

// The first time, it is not yet in cache, so it should take longer
const res = await model.invoke("Tell me a joke!");
console.log(res);

console.timeEnd();

/*
  AIMessage {
    lc_serializable: true,
    lc_kwargs: {
      content: "Why don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause they make up everything!",
      additional_kwargs: { function_call: undefined, tool_calls: undefined }
    },
    lc_namespace: [ 'langchain_core', 'messages' ],
    content: "Why don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause they make up everything!",
    name: undefined,
    additional_kwargs: { function_call: undefined, tool_calls: undefined }
  }
  default: 2.224s
*/
```

```typescript
console.time();

// The second time it is, so it goes faster
const res2 = await model.invoke("Tell me a joke!");
console.log(res2);

console.timeEnd();
/*
  AIMessage {
    lc_serializable: true,
    lc_kwargs: {
      content: "Why don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause they make up everything!",
      additional_kwargs: { function_call: undefined, tool_calls: undefined }
    },
    lc_namespace: [ 'langchain_core', 'messages' ],
    content: "Why don't scientists trust atoms?\n\nBecause they make up everything!",
    name: undefined,
    additional_kwargs: { function_call: undefined, tool_calls: undefined }
  }
  default: 181.98ms
*/
```

## Caching with Redis

LangChain also provides a Redis-based cache. This is useful if you want to share the cache across multiple processes or servers.
To use it, you'll need to install the `redis` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install ioredis @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

Then, you can pass a `cache` option when you instantiate the LLM. For example:

import RedisCacheExample from "@examples/cache/chat_models/redis.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{RedisCacheExample}</CodeBlock>

## Caching with Upstash Redis

LangChain provides an Upstash Redis-based cache. Like the Redis-based cache, this cache is useful if you want to share the cache across multiple processes or servers. The Upstash Redis client uses HTTP and supports edge environments. To use it, you'll need to install the `@upstash/redis` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @upstash/redis
```

You'll also need an [Upstash account](https://docs.upstash.com/redis#create-account) and a [Redis database](https://docs.upstash.com/redis#create-a-database) to connect to. Once you've done that, retrieve your REST URL and REST token.

Then, you can pass a `cache` option when you instantiate the LLM. For example:

import UpstashRedisCacheExample from "@examples/cache/chat_models/upstash_redis.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{UpstashRedisCacheExample}</CodeBlock>

You can also directly pass in a previously created [@upstash/redis](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/sdks/javascriptsdk/overview) client instance:

import AdvancedUpstashRedisCacheExample from "@examples/cache/chat_models/upstash_redis_advanced.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{AdvancedUpstashRedisCacheExample}</CodeBlock>

## Caching with Vercel KV

LangChain provides a Vercel KV-based cache. Like the Redis-based cache, this cache is useful if you want to share the cache across multiple processes or servers. The Vercel KV client uses HTTP and supports edge environments. To use it, you'll need to install the `@vercel/kv` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @vercel/kv
```

You'll also need a Vercel account and a [KV database](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv/kv-reference) to connect to. Once you've done that, retrieve your REST URL and REST token.

Then, you can pass a `cache` option when you instantiate the LLM. For example:

import VercelKVCacheExample from "@examples/cache/chat_models/vercel_kv.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{VercelKVCacheExample}</CodeBlock>

## Caching with Cloudflare KV

:::info
This integration is only supported in Cloudflare Workers.
:::

If you're deploying your project as a Cloudflare Worker, you can use LangChain's Cloudflare KV-powered LLM cache.

For information on how to set up KV in Cloudflare, see [the official documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/).

**Note:** If you are using TypeScript, you may need to install types if they aren't already present:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -S @cloudflare/workers-types
```

import CloudflareExample from "@examples/cache/chat_models/cloudflare_kv.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{CloudflareExample}</CodeBlock>

## Caching with MongoDB

NOTE: This section is for using MongoDB as a key-value LLM caching. For **semantic caching** see [MongoDB Atlas Semantic Cache](/docs/integrations/semantic_caching/mongodb_atlas).

LangChain provides MongoDB-based cache support. This is especially useful if your application is already using MongoDB as a database, and you don't want to add another data store integration.

To use this cache, you'll need to install the `mongodb` as well as `@langchain/mongodb`:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install mongodb @langchain/mongodb @langchain/core
```

The MongoDB cache integration does not create a collection for your cache storage.
Assuming you have already set up your collection, you can utilize it for caching as follows:

import MongoDBCacheExample from "@examples/cache/chat_models/mongodb.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{MongoDBCacheExample}</CodeBlock>

Hint: The key-value cache is stored in the collection using `prompt` as the key, and `llm` as the value. You can speed up fetching cached entries by setting up an index (not a Vector Search index) on prompt.

```
await db.collection(LLM_CACHE).createIndex({ prompt: 1 })
```

## Caching on the File System

:::warning
This cache is not recommended for production use. It is only intended for local development.
:::

LangChain provides a simple file system cache.
By default, the cache is stored in a temporary directory, but you can specify a custom directory if you want.

```typescript
const cache = await LocalFileCache.create();
```
