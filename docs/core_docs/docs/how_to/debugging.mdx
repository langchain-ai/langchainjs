# How to debug your LLM apps

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

Like building any type of software, at some point you'll need to debug when building with LLMs.
A model call will fail, or model output will be misformatted, or there will be some nested model calls and it won't be clear where along the way an incorrect output was created.

Here are a few different tools and functionalities to aid in debugging.

## Tracing

Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.
As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.
The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).

After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:

```shell
export LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="..."

# Reduce tracing latency if you are not in a serverless environment
# export LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND=true
```

Let's suppose we have an agent, and want to visualize the actions it takes and tool outputs it receives. Without any debugging, here's what we see:

import SimpleAgent from "@examples/guides/debugging/simple_agent.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{SimpleAgent}</CodeBlock>

```bash
{
  input: 'Who directed the 2023 film Oppenheimer and what is their age? What is their age in days (assume 365 days per year)?',
  output: 'So Christopher Nolan, the director of the 2023 film Oppenheimer, is 53 years old, which is approximately 19,345 days old (assuming 365 days per year).'
}
```

We don't get much output, but since we set up LangSmith we can easily see what happened under the hood:

## `verbose`

If you're prototyping in Jupyter Notebooks or running Node scripts, it can be helpful to print out the intermediate steps of a chain run.

There are a number of ways to enable printing at varying degrees of verbosity.

### `{ verbose: true }`

Setting the `verbose` parameter will cause any LangChain component with callback support (chains, models, agents, tools, retrievers) to print the inputs they receive and outputs they generate.
This is the most verbose setting and will fully log raw inputs and outputs.

He felt that \"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \"emotional\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\".[72]\nCasting\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead.

Fisher referred to them as \\\"big-atures\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible.

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\"big-atures\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\"emotional\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\".[72]\\nCasting\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead.

Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, is nearing an explosive release on July 21, 2023. Nolan movies are always incredibly secretive, twists locked alongside totems behind safe doors, actors not spilling an ounce of Earl Grey tea.\",\"score\":0.92804,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Oppenheimer (film) - Wikipedia\",\"url\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppenheimer_(film)\",\"content\":\"The film continued to hold well in the following weeks, making $32 million and $29.1 million in its fifth and sixth weekends.[174][175] As of September 10, 2023, the highest grossing territories were the United Kingdom ($72 million), Germany ($46.9 million), China ($46.8 million), France ($40.1 million) and Australia ($25.9 million).[176]\\nCritical response\\nThe film received critical acclaim.[a] Critics praised Oppenheimer primarily for its screenplay, the performances of the cast (particularly Murphy and Downey), and the visuals;[b] it was frequently cited as one of Nolan's best films,[191][192][183] and of 2023, although some criticism was aimed towards the writing of the female characters.[187] Hindustan Times reported that the film was also hailed as one of the best films of the 21st century.[193] He also chose to alternate between scenes in color and black-and-white to convey the story from both subjective and objective perspectives, respectively,[68] with most of Oppenheimer's view shown via the former, while the latter depicts a \\\"more objective view of his story from a different character's point of view\\\".[69][67] Wanting to make the film as subjective as possible, the production team decided to include visions of Oppenheimer's conceptions of the quantum world and waves of energy.[70] Nolan noted that Oppenheimer never publicly apologized for his role in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but still desired to portray Oppenheimer as feeling genuine guilt for his actions, believing this to be accurate.[71]\\nI think of any character I've dealt with, Oppenheimer is by far the most ambiguous and paradoxical. The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R.

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\"big-atures\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\"emotional\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\".[72]\\nCasting\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead.

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\"big-atures\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\"emotional\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\".[72]\\nCasting\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\",\"score\":0.92404,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"'Oppenheimer' Director Christopher Nolan On Filmmaking at 53: \\\"I Try to ...\",\"url\":\"https://www.everythingzoomer.com/arts-entertainment/2023/11/21/oppenheimer-director-christopher-nolan-on-filmmaking-at-53-i-try-to-challenge-myself-with-every-film/\",\"content\":\"Oppenheimer will be available to own on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD — including more than three hours of bonus features — on November 21.\\nRELATED:\\nVisiting the Trinity Site Featured in ‘Oppenheimer’ Is a Sobering Reminder of the Horror of Nuclear Weapons\\nBarbenheimer: How ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ Became the Unlikely Movie Marriage of the Summer\\nBlast From the Past: ‘Asteroid City’ & ‘Oppenheimer’ and the Age of Nuclear Anxiety\\nEXPLORE  HealthMoneyTravelFoodStyleBook ClubClassifieds#ZoomerDailyPolicy & PerspectiveArts & EntertainmentStars & RoyaltySex & Love\\nCONNECT  FacebookTwitterInstagram\\nSUBSCRIBE  Terms of Subscription ServiceE-NewslettersSubscribe to Zoomer Magazine\\nBROWSE  AboutMastheadContact UsAdvertise with UsPrivacy Policy\\nEverythingZoomer.com is part of the ZoomerMedia Digital Network “I think with experience — and with the experience of watching your films with an audience over the years — you do more and more recognize the human elements that people respond to, and the things that move you and the things that move the audience.”\\n “What’s interesting, as you watch the films over time, is that some of his preoccupations are the same, but then some of them have changed over time with who he is as a person and what’s going on in his own life,” Thomas said.\\n The British-American director’s latest explosive drama, Oppenheimer, which has earned upwards of US$940 million at the global box office, follows theoretical physicist J.

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\"big-atures\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\"emotional\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\".[72]\\nCasting\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\",\"score\":0.92404,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"'Oppenheimer' Director Christopher Nolan On Filmmaking at 53: \\\"I Try to ...\",\"url\":\"https://www.everythingzoomer.com/arts-entertainment/2023/11/21/oppenheimer-director-christopher-nolan-on-filmmaking-at-53-i-try-to-challenge-myself-with-every-film/\",\"content\":\"Oppenheimer will be available to own on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD — including more than three hours of bonus features — on November 21.\\nRELATED:\\nVisiting the Trinity Site Featured in ‘Oppenheimer’ Is a Sobering Reminder of the Horror of Nuclear Weapons\\nBarbenheimer: How ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ Became the Unlikely Movie Marriage of the Summer\\nBlast From the Past: ‘Asteroid City’ & ‘Oppenheimer’ and the Age of Nuclear Anxiety\\nEXPLORE  HealthMoneyTravelFoodStyleBook ClubClassifieds#ZoomerDailyPolicy & PerspectiveArts & EntertainmentStars & RoyaltySex & Love\\nCONNECT  FacebookTwitterInstagram\\nSUBSCRIBE  Terms of Subscription ServiceE-NewslettersSubscribe to Zoomer Magazine\\nBROWSE  AboutMastheadContact UsAdvertise with UsPrivacy Policy\\nEverythingZoomer.com is part of the ZoomerMedia Digital Network “I think with experience — and with the experience of watching your films with an audience over the years — you do more and more recognize the human elements that people respond to, and the things that move you and the things that move the audience.”\\n “What’s interesting, as you watch the films over time, is that some of his preoccupations are the same, but then some of them have changed over time with who he is as a person and what’s going on in his own life,” Thomas said.\\n The British-American director’s latest explosive drama, Oppenheimer, which has earned upwards of US$940 million at the global box office, follows theoretical physicist J.

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\"big-atures\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\"emotional\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\".[72]\\nCasting\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead.

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\"big-atures\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\"emotional\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\".[72]\\nCasting\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\",\"score\":0.92404,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"'Oppenheimer' Director Christopher Nolan On Filmmaking at 53: \\\"I Try to ...\",\"url\":\"https://www.everythingzoomer.com/arts-entertainment/2023/11/21/oppenheimer-director-christopher-nolan-on-filmmaking-at-53-i-try-to-challenge-myself-with-every-film/\",\"content\":\"Oppenheimer will be available to own on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD — including more than three hours of bonus features — on November 21.\\nRELATED:\\nVisiting the Trinity Site Featured in ‘Oppenheimer’ Is a Sobering Reminder of the Horror of Nuclear Weapons\\nBarbenheimer: How ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ Became the Unlikely Movie Marriage of the Summer\\nBlast From the Past: ‘Asteroid City’ & ‘Oppenheimer’ and the Age of Nuclear Anxiety\\nEXPLORE  HealthMoneyTravelFoodStyleBook ClubClassifieds#ZoomerDailyPolicy & PerspectiveArts & EntertainmentStars & RoyaltySex & Love\\nCONNECT  FacebookTwitterInstagram\\nSUBSCRIBE  Terms of Subscription ServiceE-NewslettersSubscribe to Zoomer Magazine\\nBROWSE  AboutMastheadContact UsAdvertise with UsPrivacy Policy\\nEverythingZoomer.com is part of the ZoomerMedia Digital Network “I think with experience — and with the experience of watching your films with an audience over the years — you do more and more recognize the human elements that people respond to, and the things that move you and the things that move the audience.”\\n “What’s interesting, as you watch the films over time, is that some of his preoccupations are the same, but then some of them have changed over time with who he is as a person and what’s going on in his own life,” Thomas said.\\n The British-American director’s latest explosive drama, Oppenheimer, which has earned upwards of US$940 million at the global box office, follows theoretical physicist J.

To signal his conceit, he stamps the film with the words “fission” (a splitting into parts) and “fusion” (a merging of elements); Nolan being Nolan, he further complicates the film by recurrently kinking up the overarching chronology — it is a lot.\\n It’s also at Berkeley that Oppenheimer meets the project’s military head, Leslie Groves (a predictably good Damon), who makes him Los Alamos’s director, despite the leftist causes he supported — among them, the fight against fascism during the Spanish Civil War — and some of his associations, including with Communist Party members like his brother, Frank (Dylan Arnold).\\n\",\"score\":0.91831,\"raw_content\":null}]",

Fisher referred to them as \\\"big-atures\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\"emotional\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\".[72]\\nCasting\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead.

To signal his conceit, he stamps the film with the words “fission” (a splitting into parts) and “fusion” (a merging of elements); Nolan being Nolan, he further complicates the film by recurrently kinking up the overarching chronology — it is a lot.\n It’s also at Berkeley that Oppenheimer meets the project’s military head, Leslie Groves (a predictably good Damon), who makes him Los Alamos’s director, despite the leftist causes he supported — among them, the fight against fascism during the Spanish Civil War — and some of his associations, including with Communist Party members like his brother, Frank (Dylan Arnold).\n","score":0.97519,"raw_content":null},{"title":"Oppenheimer's Grandson Reacts to New Christopher Nolan Film | TIME","url":"https://time.com/6297743/oppenheimer-grandson-movie-interview/","content":"July 25, 2023 3:32 PM EDT.

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \"big-atures\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \"emotional\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\".[72]\nCasting\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\", while also underscoring that it is a \"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.","score":0.92204,"raw_content":null},{"title":"Oppenheimer (2023) - Full Cast & Crew - IMDb","url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/fullcredits/","content":"Oppenheimer (2023) cast and crew credits, including actors, actresses, directors, writers and more.

Philosophy professor David Kyle Johnson wrote that \"Inception became a classic almost as soon as it was projected on silver screens\", praising its exploration of philosophical ideas, including leap of faith and allegory of the cave.[97] The film grossed over $836 million worldwide.[98] Nominated for eight Academy Awards—including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay—it won Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects.[99] Nolan was nominated for a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Director, among other accolades.[40]\nAround the release of The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Nolan's third and final Batman film, Joseph Bevan of the British Film Institute wrote a profile on him: \"In the space of just over a decade, Christopher Nolan has shot from promising British indie director to undisputed master of a new brand of intelligent escapism. He further wrote that Nolan's body of work reflect \"a heterogeneity of conditions of products\" extending from low-budget films to lucrative blockbusters, \"a wide range of genres and settings\" and \"a diversity of styles that trumpet his versatility\".[193]\nDavid Bordwell, a film theorist, wrote that Nolan has been able to blend his \"experimental impulses\" with the demands of mainstream entertainment, describing his oeuvre as \"experiments with cinematic time by means of techniques of subjective viewpoint and crosscutting\".[194] Nolan's use of practical, in-camera effects, miniatures and models, as well as shooting on celluloid film, has been highly influential in early 21st century cinema.[195][196] IndieWire wrote in 2019 that, Nolan \"kept a viable alternate model of big-budget filmmaking alive\", in an era where blockbuster filmmaking has become \"a largely computer-generated art form\".[196] Initially reluctant to make a sequel, he agreed after Warner Bros. repeatedly insisted.[78] Nolan wanted to expand on the noir quality of the first film by broadening the canvas and taking on \"the dynamic of a story of the city, a large crime story ... where you're looking at the police, the justice system, the vigilante, the poor people, the rich people, the criminals\".[79] Continuing to minimalise the use of CGI, Nolan employed high-resolution IMAX cameras, making it the first major motion picture to use this technology.[80][81]","score":0.90288,"raw_content":null},{"title":"Christopher Nolan | Biography, Movies, Batman, Oppenheimer, & Facts ...","url":"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Christopher-Nolan-British-director","content":"The sci-fi drama depicted the efforts of a group of scientists to relocate humanity from an Earth vitiated by war and famine to another planet by way of a wormhole. The film turns on this character’s attempt to move past the boundaries of the technology in order to actually plant an idea in a dreamer’s head. His 2023 film Oppenheimer, depicts J. Robert Oppenheimer’s role in the development of the atomic bomb and the later security hearing over his alleged ties to communism. It used a destabilizing reverse-order story line to mirror the fractured mental state of its protagonist, a man with short-term amnesia who is trying to track down the person who murdered his wife. The Dark Knight (2008) leaned even more heavily on the moral and structural decay of its setting, fictional Gotham City, and it revived such classic Batman villains as the Joker (played by Heath Ledger).","score":0.90219,"raw_content":null}]"

Philosophy professor David Kyle Johnson wrote that \"Inception became a classic almost as soon as it was projected on silver screens\", praising its exploration of philosophical ideas, including leap of faith and allegory of the cave.[97] The film grossed over $836 million worldwide.[98] Nominated for eight Academy Awards—including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay—it won Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects.[99] Nolan was nominated for a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Director, among other accolades.[40]\nAround the release of The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Nolan's third and final Batman film, Joseph Bevan of the British Film Institute wrote a profile on him: \"In the space of just over a decade, Christopher Nolan has shot from promising British indie director to undisputed master of a new brand of intelligent escapism. He further wrote that Nolan's body of work reflect \"a heterogeneity of conditions of products\" extending from low-budget films to lucrative blockbusters, \"a wide range of genres and settings\" and \"a diversity of styles that trumpet his versatility\".[193]\nDavid Bordwell, a film theorist, wrote that Nolan has been able to blend his \"experimental impulses\" with the demands of mainstream entertainment, describing his oeuvre as \"experiments with cinematic time by means of techniques of subjective viewpoint and crosscutting\".[194] Nolan's use of practical, in-camera effects, miniatures and models, as well as shooting on celluloid film, has been highly influential in early 21st century cinema.[195][196] IndieWire wrote in 2019 that, Nolan \"kept a viable alternate model of big-budget filmmaking alive\", in an era where blockbuster filmmaking has become \"a largely computer-generated art form\".[196] Initially reluctant to make a sequel, he agreed after Warner Bros. repeatedly insisted.[78] Nolan wanted to expand on the noir quality of the first film by broadening the canvas and taking on \"the dynamic of a story of the city, a large crime story ... where you're looking at the police, the justice system, the vigilante, the poor people, the rich people, the criminals\".[79] Continuing to minimalise the use of CGI, Nolan employed high-resolution IMAX cameras, making it the first major motion picture to use this technology.[80][81]","score":0.93205,"raw_content":null},{"title":"Christopher Nolan | Biography, Movies, Batman, Oppenheimer, & Facts ...","url":"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Christopher-Nolan-British-director","content":"The sci-fi drama depicted the efforts of a group of scientists to relocate humanity from an Earth vitiated by war and famine to another planet by way of a wormhole. The film turns on this character’s attempt to move past the boundaries of the technology in order to actually plant an idea in a dreamer’s head. His 2023 film Oppenheimer, depicts J. Robert Oppenheimer’s role in the development of the atomic bomb and the later security hearing over his alleged ties to communism. It used a destabilizing reverse-order story line to mirror the fractured mental state of its protagonist, a man with short-term amnesia who is trying to track down the person who murdered his wife. The Dark Knight (2008) leaned even more heavily on the moral and structural decay of its setting, fictional Gotham City, and it revived such classic Batman villains as the Joker (played by Heath Ledger).","score":0.90859,"raw_content":null}]"
