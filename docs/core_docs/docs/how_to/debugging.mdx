# How to debug your LLM apps

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

Like building any type of software, at some point you'll need to debug when building with LLMs.
A model call will fail, or model output will be misformatted, or there will be some nested model calls and it won't be clear where along the way an incorrect output was created.

Here are a few different tools and functionalities to aid in debugging.

## Tracing

Platforms with tracing capabilities like [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) are the most comprehensive solutions for debugging.
These platforms make it easy to not only log and visualize LLM apps, but also to actively debug, test and refine them.

For anyone building production-grade LLM applications, we highly recommend using a platform like this.

## `verbose`

If you're prototyping in Jupyter Notebooks or running Node scripts, it can be helpful to print out the intermediate steps of a chain run.

There are a number of ways to enable printing at varying degrees of verbosity.

Let's suppose we have a simple agent, and want to visualize the actions it takes and tool outputs it receives. Without any debugging, here's what we see:

import SimpleAgent from "@examples/guides/debugging/simple_agent.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{SimpleAgent}</CodeBlock>

```typescript
const result = await agentExecutor.invoke({
  input:
    "Who directed the 2023 film Oppenheimer and what is their age? What is their age in days (assume 365 days per year)?",
});
console.log(result);
```

```bash
{
  input: 'Who directed the 2023 film Oppenheimer and what is their age? What is their age in days (assume 365 days per year)?',
  output: 'The 2023 film "Oppenheimer" was directed by Christopher Nolan, who was born on July 30, 1970. As of 2023, Christopher Nolan is 52 years old. His age in days, assuming 365 days per year, is approximately 19,525 days.'
}
```

### `{ verbose: true }`

Setting the `verbose` parameter will cause any LangChain component with callback support (chains, models, agents, tools, retrievers) to print the inputs they receive and outputs they generate.
This is the most verbose setting and will fully log raw inputs and outputs.

import SimpleAgentVerbose from "@examples/guides/debugging/simple_agent_verbose.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{SimpleAgentVerbose}</CodeBlock>

```typescript
const result = await agentExecutor.invoke({
  input:
    "Who directed the 2023 film Oppenheimer and what is their age? What is their age in days (assume 365 days per year)?",
});
console.log(result);
```

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \"big-atures\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \"emotional\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\".[72]\nCasting\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\", while also underscoring that it is a \"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.","score":0.96785,"raw_content":null},{"title":"Oppenheimer (2023) - Full Cast & Crew - IMDb","url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/fullcredits/","content":"Ludwig Göransson Cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema ... director of photography Editing by Jennifer Lame Casting By John Papsidera ...

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\"big-atures\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\"emotional\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\".[72]\\nCasting\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\",\"score\":0.96785,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Oppenheimer (2023) - Full Cast & Crew - IMDb\",\"url\":\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/fullcredits/\",\"content\":\"Ludwig Göransson Cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema ... director of photography Editing by Jennifer Lame Casting By John Papsidera ...

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\"big-atures\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\"emotional\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\".[72]\\nCasting\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead.

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\"big-atures\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\"emotional\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\".[72]\\nCasting\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\",\"score\":0.96785,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Oppenheimer (2023) - Full Cast & Crew - IMDb\",\"url\":\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/fullcredits/\",\"content\":\"Ludwig Göransson Cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema ... director of photography Editing by Jennifer Lame Casting By John Papsidera ...

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\"big-atures\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\"emotional\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\".[72]\\nCasting\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\",\"score\":0.96785,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Oppenheimer (2023) - Full Cast & Crew - IMDb\",\"url\":\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/fullcredits/\",\"content\":\"Ludwig Göransson Cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema ... director of photography Editing by Jennifer Lame Casting By John Papsidera ...

The movie, adapted from the Pulitzer ...\",\"score\":0.97379,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Oppenheimer (film) - Wikipedia\",\"url\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppenheimer_(film)\",\"content\":\"The film continued to hold well in the following weeks, making $32 million and $29.1 million in its fifth and sixth weekends.[174][175] As of September 10, 2023, the highest grossing territories were the United Kingdom ($72 million), Germany ($46.9 million), China ($46.8 million), France ($40.1 million) and Australia ($25.9 million).[176]\\nCritical response\\nThe film received critical acclaim.[a] Critics praised Oppenheimer primarily for its screenplay, the performances of the cast (particularly Murphy and Downey), and the visuals;[b] it was frequently cited as one of Nolan's best films,[191][192][183] and of 2023, although some criticism was aimed towards the writing of the female characters.[187] Hindustan Times reported that the film was also hailed as one of the best films of the 21st century.[193] He also chose to alternate between scenes in color and black-and-white to convey the story from both subjective and objective perspectives, respectively,[68] with most of Oppenheimer's view shown via the former, while the latter depicts a \\\"more objective view of his story from a different character's point of view\\\".[69][67] Wanting to make the film as subjective as possible, the production team decided to include visions of Oppenheimer's conceptions of the quantum world and waves of energy.[70] Nolan noted that Oppenheimer never publicly apologized for his role in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but still desired to portray Oppenheimer as feeling genuine guilt for his actions, believing this to be accurate.[71]\\nI think of any character I've dealt with, Oppenheimer is by far the most ambiguous and paradoxical. The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\"big-atures\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\"emotional\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\".[72]\\nCasting\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\",\"score\":0.96785,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Oppenheimer (2023) - Full Cast & Crew - IMDb\",\"url\":\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/fullcredits/\",\"content\":\"Ludwig Göransson Cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema ... director of photography Editing by Jennifer Lame Casting By John Papsidera ...

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\"big-atures\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\"emotional\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\".[72]\\nCasting\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\",\"score\":0.96785,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Oppenheimer (2023) - Full Cast & Crew - IMDb\",\"url\":\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/fullcredits/\",\"content\":\"Ludwig Göransson Cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema ... director of photography Editing by Jennifer Lame Casting By John Papsidera ...

The movie, adapted from the Pulitzer ...\",\"score\":0.97379,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Oppenheimer (film) - Wikipedia\",\"url\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppenheimer_(film)\",\"content\":\"The film continued to hold well in the following weeks, making $32 million and $29.1 million in its fifth and sixth weekends.[174][175] As of September 10, 2023, the highest grossing territories were the United Kingdom ($72 million), Germany ($46.9 million), China ($46.8 million), France ($40.1 million) and Australia ($25.9 million).[176]\\nCritical response\\nThe film received critical acclaim.[a] Critics praised Oppenheimer primarily for its screenplay, the performances of the cast (particularly Murphy and Downey), and the visuals;[b] it was frequently cited as one of Nolan's best films,[191][192][183] and of 2023, although some criticism was aimed towards the writing of the female characters.[187] Hindustan Times reported that the film was also hailed as one of the best films of the 21st century.[193] He also chose to alternate between scenes in color and black-and-white to convey the story from both subjective and objective perspectives, respectively,[68] with most of Oppenheimer's view shown via the former, while the latter depicts a \\\"more objective view of his story from a different character's point of view\\\".[69][67] Wanting to make the film as subjective as possible, the production team decided to include visions of Oppenheimer's conceptions of the quantum world and waves of energy.[70] Nolan noted that Oppenheimer never publicly apologized for his role in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but still desired to portray Oppenheimer as feeling genuine guilt for his actions, believing this to be accurate.[71]\\nI think of any character I've dealt with, Oppenheimer is by far the most ambiguous and paradoxical. The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\"big-atures\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\"emotional\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\".[72]\\nCasting\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\",\"score\":0.96785,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Oppenheimer (2023) - Full Cast & Crew - IMDb\",\"url\":\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/fullcredits/\",\"content\":\"Ludwig Göransson Cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema ... director of photography Editing by Jennifer Lame Casting By John Papsidera ...

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\"big-atures\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\"emotional\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\".[72]\\nCasting\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\",\"score\":0.96785,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Oppenheimer (2023) - Full Cast & Crew - IMDb\",\"url\":\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/fullcredits/\",\"content\":\"Ludwig Göransson Cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema ... director of photography Editing by Jennifer Lame Casting By John Papsidera ...

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \"big-atures\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \"emotional\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\".[72]\nCasting\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\", while also underscoring that it is a \"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.","score":0.90685,"raw_content":null}]"

The scene, which features Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss, encapsulates the themes of hubris and regret that will be explored more deeply over the course of the film.\n We divided the two timelines into fission and fusion, the two different approaches to releasing nuclear energy in this devastating form to try and suggest to the audience the two different timelines. And behind him, out of focus, the great Emily Blunt who’s going to become so important to the film as Kitty Oppenheimer, who gradually comes more into focus over the course of the first reel.","score":0.93024,"raw_content":null},{"title":"Here's the full list of 2024 Golden Globe winners - Boston.com","url":"https://www.boston.com/culture/entertainment/2024/01/08/heres-the-full-list-of-2024-golden-globe-winners/","content":"Best Movie Drama: “Oppenheimer”\nBest Movie Musical or Comedy: “Poor Things”\nTelevision Comedy Series: “The Bear”\nTelevision Drama Series: “Succession”\nLimited Series, Anthology Series or Motion Picture Made for Television: “Beef”\nCinematic and Box Office Achievement: “Barbie”\nMale Actor in a Movie Musical or Comedy: Paul Giamatti, “The Holdovers”\nFemale Actor in a Movie Musical or Comedy: Emma Stone, “Poor Things”\nActor in a Movie Drama: Cillian Murphy, “Oppenheimer”\nFemale Actor in a Movie Drama: Lily Gladstone, “Killers of the Flower Moon”\nFemale Actor in a Supporting Movie Role: Da’Vine Joy Randolph, “The Holdovers”\nMale Actor in a Supporting Movie Role: Robert Downey Jr., “Oppenheimer”\nFemale Actor in a Limited Series, Anthology Series, or a Motion Picture Made for Television: Ali Wong, “Beef”\nActor in a Limited Series, Anthology Series, or a Motion Picture Made for Television: Steven Yeun, “Beef”\nSupporting Female Actor in a Television Series: Elizabeth Debicki, “The Crown”\nSupporting Male Actor in a Television Series: Matthew Macfadyen, “Succession”\nBest Screenplay: “Anatomy of a Fall,” Justine Triet and Arthur Harari\nFemale Actor in a Television Drama: Sarah Snook, “Succession”\nMale Actor in a Television Comedy: Jeremy Allen White, “The Bear”\nStand-up Comedy Television Special: Ricky Gervais, “Armageddon”\nBest Motion Picture, Non-English: “Anatomy of a Fall” (France)\nFemale Actor in a Television Comedy: Ayo Edebiri, “The Bear”\nMale Actor in a Television Drama: Kieran Culkin, “Succession”\nAnimated Film: “The Boy and the Heron”\nDirector: Christopher Nolan, “Oppenheimer”\nScore: “Oppenheimer,” Ludwig Göransson\nOriginal Song: “What Was I Made For?” from “Barbie,″ music and lyrics by Billie Eilish O’Connell and Finneas O’Connell\nNeed weekend plans?\n Most Popular\nIn Related News\nWatch: Dorchester's Ayo Edebiri shouts out Hollywood assistants in Golden Globes acceptance speech\nPartnership Offers\n©2024 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC\nBoston.com Newsletter Signup\nBoston.com Logo\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

## Other callbacks

`Callbacks` are what we use to execute any functionality within a component outside the primary component logic.
All of the above solutions use `Callbacks` under the hood to log intermediate steps of components.
There are a number of `Callbacks` relevant for debugging that come with LangChain out of the box, like the [`ConsoleCallbackHandler`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core_tracers_console.ConsoleCallbackHandler.html).
You can also implement your own callbacks to execute custom functionality.
