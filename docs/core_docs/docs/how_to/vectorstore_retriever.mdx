# How use a vector store to retrieve data

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Vector stores](/docs/concepts/#vectorstores)
- [Retrievers](/docs/concepts/retrievers)
- [Text splitters](/docs/concepts/text_splitters)
- [Chaining runnables](/docs/how_to/sequence/)

:::

Vector stores can be converted into retrievers using the [`.asRetriever()`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.vectorstores.VectorStore.html#asRetriever) method, which allows you to more easily compose them in chains.

Below, we show a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chain that performs question answering over documents using the following steps:

1. Initialize an vector store
2. Create a retriever from that vector store
3. Compose a question answering chain
4. Ask questions!

Each of the steps has multiple sub steps and potential configurations, but we'll go through one common flow.
First, install the required dependency:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

You can download the `state_of_the_union.txt` file [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/docs/docs/how_to/state_of_the_union.txt).

import RetrievalQAExample from "@examples/chains/retrieval_qa.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{RetrievalQAExample}</CodeBlock>

Let's walk through what's happening here.

1. We first load a long text and split it into smaller documents using a text splitter.
   We then load those documents (which also embeds the documents using the passed `OpenAIEmbeddings` instance) into HNSWLib, our vector store, creating our index.

2. Though we can query the vector store directly, we convert the vector store into a retriever to return retrieved documents in the right format for the question answering chain.

3. We initialize a retrieval chain, which we'll call later in step 4.

4. We ask questions!

## Next steps

You've now learned how to convert a vector store as a retriever.

See the individual sections for deeper dives on specific retrievers, the [broader tutorial on RAG](/docs/tutorials/rag), or this section to learn how to
[create your own custom retriever over any data source](/docs/how_to/custom_retriever/).
