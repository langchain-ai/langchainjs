    "# How to use LangChain tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools are interfaces that an agent, chain, or LLM can use to interact with the world.\n",
    "They combine a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The name of the tool\n",
    "2. A description of what the tool is\n",
    "3. JSON schema of what the inputs to the tool are\n",
    "4. The function to call \n",
    "5. Whether the result of a tool should be returned directly to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to have all this information because this information can be used to build action-taking systems! The name, description, and schema can be used to prompt the LLM so it knows how to specify what action to take, and then the function to call is equivalent to taking that action.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simpler the input to a tool is, the easier it is for an LLM to be able to use it.\n",
    "Many agents will only work with tools that have a single string input.\n",
    "For a list of agent types and which ones work with more complicated inputs, please see [this documentation](https://js.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the name, description, and schema (if used) are all used in the prompt. Therefore, it is vitally important that they are clear and describe exactly how the tool should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Default Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at how to work with tools. To do this, we'll work with a built in tool."
