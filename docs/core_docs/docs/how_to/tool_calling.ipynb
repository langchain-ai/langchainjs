        "We use the term tool calling interchangeably with function calling. Although\n",
        "function calling is sometimes meant to refer to invocations of a single function,\n",
        "we treat all models as though they can return multiple tool or function calls in \n",
        "each message.\n",
        ":::\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Tool calling allows a chat model to respond to a given prompt by \"calling a tool\".\n",
        "While the name implies that the model is performing \n",
        "some action, this is actually not the case! The model generates the \n",
        "arguments to a tool, and actually running the tool (or not) is up to the user.\n",
        "For example, if you want to [extract output matching some schema](/docs/how_to/structured_output/) \n",
        "from unstructured text, you could give the model an \"extraction\" tool that takes \n",
        "parameters matching the desired schema, then treat the generated output as your final \n",
        "result.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, tool calling goes beyond [structured output](/docs/how_to/structured_output/)\n",
        "since you can pass responses to caled tools back to the model to create longer interactions.\n",
        "For instance, given a search engine tool, an LLM might handle a \n",
        "query by first issuing a call to the search engine with arguments. The system calling the LLM can \n",
        "receive the tool call, execute it, and return the output to the LLM to inform its \n",
        "response. LangChain includes a suite of [built-in tools](/docs/integrations/tools/) \n",
        "and supports several methods for defining your own [custom tools](/docs/how_to/custom_tools). \n",
