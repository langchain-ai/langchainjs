# How to load PDF files

> [Portable Document Format (PDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF), standardized as ISO 32000, is a file format developed by Adobe in 1992 to present documents, including text formatting and images, in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems.

This covers how to load `PDF` documents into the Document format that we use downstream.

By default, one document will be created for each page in the PDF file. You can change this behavior by setting the `splitPages` option to `false`.

## Setup

```bash npm2yarn
npm install pdf-parse
```

## Usage, one document per page

```typescript
import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf";
// Or, in web environments:
// import { WebPDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/web/pdf";
// const blob = new Blob(); // e.g. from a file input
// const loader = new WebPDFLoader(blob);

const loader = new PDFLoader("src/document_loaders/example_data/example.pdf");

const docs = await loader.load();
```

## Usage, one document per file

```typescript
import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf";

const loader = new PDFLoader("src/document_loaders/example_data/example.pdf", {
  splitPages: false,
});

const docs = await loader.load();
```

## Usage, custom `pdfjs` build

By default we use the `pdfjs` build bundled with `pdf-parse`, which is compatible with most environments, including Node.js and modern browsers. If you want to use a more recent version of `pdfjs-dist` or if you want to use a custom build of `pdfjs-dist`, you can do so by providing a custom `pdfjs` function that returns a promise that resolves to the `PDFJS` object.

In the following example we use the "legacy" (see [pdfjs docs](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#which-browsersenvironments-are-supported)) build of `pdfjs-dist`, which includes several polyfills not included in the default build.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install pdfjs-dist
```

```typescript
import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf";

const loader = new PDFLoader("src/document_loaders/example_data/example.pdf", {
  // you may need to add `.then(m => m.default)` to the end of the import
  pdfjs: () => import("pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.js"),
});
```

## Eliminating extra spaces

PDFs come in many varieties, which makes reading them a challenge. The loader parses individual text elements and joins them together with a space by default, but
if you are seeing excessive spaces, this may not be the desired behavior. In that case, you can override the separator with an empty string like this:

```typescript
import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf";

const loader = new PDFLoader("src/document_loaders/example_data/example.pdf", {
  parsedItemSeparator: "",
});

const docs = await loader.load();
```
