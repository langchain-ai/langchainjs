        "By themselves, language models can't take actions - they just output text.\n",
        "Agents are systems that use an LLM as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and what the inputs to those actions should be.\n",
        "The results of those actions can then be fed back into the agent and it determine whether more actions are needed, or whether it is okay to finish.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial we will build an agent that can interact with multiple different tools: one being a local database, the other being a search engine. You will be able to ask this agent questions, watch it call tools, and have conversations with it.\n",

        "This section will cover building with LangChain Agents. LangChain Agents are fine for getting started, but past a certain point you will likely want flexibility and control that they do not offer. For working with more advanced agents, we'd recommend checking out [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs).\n",

        "- Using [language models](/docs/concepts/chat_models), in particular their tool calling ability\n",
        "- Creating a [Retriever](/docs/concepts/retrievers) to expose specific information to our agent\n",
        "- Using a Search [Tool](/docs/concepts/tools) to look up things online\n",
        "- [`Chat History`](/docs/concepts/chat_history), which allows a chatbot to \"remember\" past interactions and take them into account when responding to followup questions. \n",
        "- Debugging and tracing your application using [LangSmith](/docs/concepts/#langsmith)\n",

        "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "This guide (and most of the other guides in the documentation) uses [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and assumes the reader is as well. Jupyter notebooks are perfect for learning how to work with LLM systems because oftentimes things can go wrong (unexpected output, API down, etc) and going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them.\n",
        "\n",
        "This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebook. See [here](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions on how to install.\n",

        "Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\n",
