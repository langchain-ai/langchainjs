# Pairwise Embedding Distance

One way to measure the similarity (or dissimilarity) between two predictions on a shared or similar input is to embed the predictions and compute a vector distance between the two embeddings.

You can load the `pairwise_embedding_distance` evaluator to do this.

**Note:** This returns a **distance** score, meaning that the lower the number, the **more** similar the outputs are, according to their embedded representation.
