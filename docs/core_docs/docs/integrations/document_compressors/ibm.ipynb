    "\n",
    "To access IBM WatsonxAI models you'll need to create an IBM watsonx.ai account, get an API key or any other type of credentials, and install the `@langchain/community` integration package.\n",

    "### Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "Head to [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/login) to sign up to IBM watsonx.ai and generate an API key or provide any other authentication form as presented below.\n",

    "\n",
