# Google Places Tool

The Google Places Tool allows your agent to utilize the Google Places API in order to find addresses,
phone numbers, website, etc. from text about a location listed on Google Places.

## Setup

You will need to get an API key from [Google here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview)
and [enable the new Places API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/places.googleapis.com). Then, set your API key
as `process.env.GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` or pass it in as an `apiKey` constructor argument.

## Usage

import ToolExample from "@examples/tools/google_places.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ToolExample}</CodeBlock>
