# Web Browser Tool

The Webbrowser Tool gives your agent the ability to visit a website and extract information. It is described to the agent as

```
useful for when you need to find something on or summarize a webpage. input should be a comma separated list of "valid URL including protocol","what you want to find on the page or empty string for a summary".
```

It exposes two modes of operation:

- when called by the Agent with only a URL it produces a summary of the website contents
- when called by the Agent with a URL and a description of what to find it will instead use an in-memory Vector Store to find the most relevant snippets and summarise those

```bash npm2yarn
