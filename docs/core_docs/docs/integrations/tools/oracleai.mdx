# Oracle AI Vector Search: Generate Summary

## Generate Summary

The Oracle AI Vector Search LangChain library offers a suite of APIs designed for document summarization. It supports multiple summarization providers such as Database, OCIGENAI, HuggingFace, among others, allowing you to select the provider that best meets their needs. To utilize these capabilities, you must configure the summary parameters as specified. For detailed information on these parameters, please consult the [Oracle AI Vector Search Guide book](https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=GUID-EC9DDB58-6A15-4B36-BA66-ECBA20D2CE57).

Note: You may need to set proxy if you want to use some 3rd party summary generation providers other than Oracle's in-house and default provider: 'database'. If you don't have proxy, please remove the proxy parameter when you instantiate the OracleSummary.

The following sample code will show how to generate summary:

```typescript
import {OracleSummary} from "@langchain/oracle";

// proxy to be used when we instantiate summary and embedder object
const proxy = "";

/*
// using 'ocigenai' provider
const summary_params = {
    "provider": "ocigenai",
    "credential_name": "OCI_CRED",
    "url": "https://inference.generativeai.us-chicago-1.oci.oraclecloud.com/20231130/actions/summarizeText",
    "model": "cohere.command",
};

// using 'huggingface' provider
const summary_params = {
    "provider": "huggingface",
    "credential_name": "HF_CRED",
    "url": "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/",
    "model": "facebook/bart-large-cnn",
    "wait_for_model": "true"
};
*/

// using 'database' provider
const summary_params = {
  "provider": "database",
  "glevel": "S",
  "numParagraphs": 1,
  "language": "english",
};

// get the summary instance
// Remove proxy if not required
const model = new OracleSummary(conn, summary_params, proxy);
const summary = await model.getSummary(
    "In the heart of the forest, "
    + "a lone fox ventured out at dusk, seeking a lost treasure. "
    + "With each step, memories flooded back, guiding its path. "
    + "As the moon rose high, illuminating the night, the fox unearthed "
    + "not gold, but a forgotten friendship, worth more than any riches.");

// verify
console.log(`Summary generated by OracleSummary: ${summary}`);
```
