# Web Loaders

These loaders are used to load web resources. They do not involve the local file system.

import { IndexTable } from "@theme/FeatureTables";

If you'd like to write your own document loader, see [this how-to](/docs/how_to/document_loader_custom/). If you'd like to contribute an integration, see [Contributing integrations](/docs/contributing).
