# Azure Blob Storage Container

:::tip Compatibility
Only available on Node.js.
:::

This covers how to load a container on Azure Blob Storage into LangChain documents.

## Setup

To run this loader, you'll need to have Unstructured already set up and ready to use at an available URL endpoint. It can also be configured to run locally.

See the docs [here](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/file_loaders/unstructured) for information on how to do that.

You'll also need to install the official Azure Storage Blob client library:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core @azure/storage-blob
```

## Usage

Once Unstructured is configured, you can use the Azure Blob Storage Container loader to load files and then convert them into a Document.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/document_loaders/azure_blob_storage_container.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>
