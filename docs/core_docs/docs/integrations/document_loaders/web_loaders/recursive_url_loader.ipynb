    "When loading content from a website, we may want to process load all URLs on a page.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's look at the [LangChain.js introduction](/docs/introduction) docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has many interesting child pages that we may want to load, split, and later retrieve in bulk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is traversing the tree of child pages and assembling a list!\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this using the `RecursiveUrlLoader`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also gives us the flexibility to exclude some children, customize the extractor, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To access `RecursiveUrlLoader` document loader you'll need to install the `@langchain/community` integration, and the [`jsdom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom) package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to get automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=\"true\"\n",
    "# export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=\"your-api-key\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "The LangChain RecursiveUrlLoader integration lives in the `@langchain/community` package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{=mdx}\n",
    "import IntegrationInstallTooltip from \"@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx\";\n",

    "\n",
    "<Npm2Yarn>\n",
    "  @langchain/community jsdom\n",
    "</Npm2Yarn>\n",
    "\n",
    "We also suggest adding a package like [`html-to-text`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-text) or\n",
    "[`@mozilla/readability`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mozilla/readability) for extracting the raw text from the page.\n",
