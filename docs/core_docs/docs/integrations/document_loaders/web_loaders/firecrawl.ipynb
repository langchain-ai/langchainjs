    "[FireCrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) crawls and convert any website into LLM-ready data. It crawls all accessible sub-pages and give you clean markdown and metadata for each. No sitemap required.\n",
    "\n",
    "FireCrawl handles complex tasks such as reverse proxies, caching, rate limits, and content blocked by JavaScript. Built by the [mendable.ai](https://mendable.ai) team.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide shows how to scrap and crawl entire websites and load them using the `FireCrawlLoader` in LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To access `FireCrawlLoader` document loader you'll need to install the `@langchain/community` integration, and the `@mendable/firecrawl-js` package. Then create a **[FireCrawl](https://firecrawl.dev)** account and get an API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "Sign up and get your free [FireCrawl API key](https://firecrawl.dev) to start. FireCrawl offers 300 free credits to get you started, and it's [open-source](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl) in case you want to self-host.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've done this set the `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` environment variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=\"your-api-key\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to get automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=\"true\"\n",
    "# export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=\"your-api-key\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "The LangChain FireCrawlLoader integration lives in the `@langchain/community` package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{=mdx}\n",
    "import IntegrationInstallTooltip from \"@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx\";\n",
