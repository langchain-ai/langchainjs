# Figma

This example goes over how to load data from a Figma file.
You will need a Figma access token in order to get started.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/document_loaders/figma.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

You can find your Figma file's key and node ids by opening the file in your browser and extracting them from the URL:

```
https://www.figma.com/file/<YOUR FILE KEY HERE>/LangChainJS-Test?type=whiteboard&node-id=<YOUR NODE ID HERE>&t=e6lqWkKecuYQRyRg-0
```
