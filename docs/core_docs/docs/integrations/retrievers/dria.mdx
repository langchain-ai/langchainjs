# Dria Retriever

The [Dria](https://dria.co/) retriever allows an agent to perform a text-based search across a comprehensive knowledge hub.

## Setup

To use Dria retriever, first install Dria JS client:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install dria
```

You need to provide two things to the retriever:

- **API Key**: you can get yours at your [profile page](https://dria.co/) when you create an account.
- **Contract ID**: accessible at the top of the page when viewing a knowledge or in its URL.
  For example, the Bitcoin whitepaper is uploaded on Dria at https://dria.co/knowledge/2KxNbEb040GKQ1DSDNDsA-Fsj_BlQIEAlzBNuiapBR0, so its contract ID is `2KxNbEb040GKQ1DSDNDsA-Fsj_BlQIEAlzBNuiapBR0`.
  Contract ID can be omitted during instantiation, and later be set via `dria.contractId = "your-contract"`

Dria retriever exposes the underlying [Dria client](https://npmjs.com/package/dria) as well, refer to the [Dria documentation](https://github.com/firstbatchxyz/dria-js-client?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) to learn more about the client.
