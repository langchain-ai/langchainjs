    "This guide will help you getting started with such a retriever backed by a [Weaviate vector store](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/weaviate). For detailed documentation of all features and configurations head to the [API reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.retrievers_self_query.SelfQueryRetriever.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A [self-query retriever](/docs/how_to/self_query/) retrieves documents by dynamically generating metadata filters based on some input query. This allows the retriever to account for underlying document metadata in addition to pure semantic similarity when fetching results.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses a module called a `Translator` that generates a filter based on information about metadata fields and the query language that a given vector store supports.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration details\n",
    "\n",
    "| Backing vector store | Self-host | Cloud offering | Package | [Py support](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/retrievers/self_query/weaviate_self_query/) |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",

    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Set up a Weaviate instance as documented [here](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/weaviate). Set the following environment variables if relevant:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ts\n",
    "// Include port if relevant, e.g. \"localhost:8080\"\n",
    "process.env.WEAVIATE_URL = \"YOUR_WEAVIATE_URL\";\n",
    "// Optional, for cloud deployments\n",
    "process.env.WEAVIATE_API_KEY = \"YOUR_API_KEY\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to get automated tracing from individual queries, you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// process.env.LANGSMITH_API_KEY = \"<YOUR API KEY HERE>\";\n",
    "// process.env.LANGSMITH_TRACING = \"true\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector store lives in the `@langchain/weaviate` package. You'll also need to install the `langchain` package to import the main `SelfQueryRetriever` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The official Weaviate SDK (`weaviate-client`) is automatically installed as a dependency of `@langchain/weaviate`, but you may wish to install it independently as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we'll also use OpenAI embeddings, so you'll need to install the `@langchain/openai` package and [obtain an API key](https://platform.openai.com):\n",
