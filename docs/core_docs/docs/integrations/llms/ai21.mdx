# AI21

You can get started with AI21Labs' Jurassic family of models, as well as see a full list of available foundational models, by signing up for an API key [on their website](https://www.ai21.com/).

Here's an example of initializing an instance in LangChain.js:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import AI21Example from "@examples/models/llm/ai21.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{AI21Example}</CodeBlock>
