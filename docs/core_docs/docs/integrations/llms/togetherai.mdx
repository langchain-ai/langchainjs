# Together AI

:::caution
You are currently on a page documenting the use of Together AI models as [text completion models](/docs/concepts/#llms). Many popular models available on Together AI are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/#chat-models).

You may be looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/togetherai/).
:::

Here's an example of calling a Together AI model as an LLM:

import TogetherAI from "@examples/models/llm/togetherai.ts";
import TogetherAIStream from "@examples/models/llm/togetherai_stream.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{TogetherAI}</CodeBlock>

You can see a LangSmith trace of this example [here](https://smith.langchain.com/public/f49160bd-a6cd-4234-96de-b8106a9e08a7/r)
:::

You can run other models through Together by changing the `modelName` parameter.

You can find a full list of models on [Together's website](https://api.together.xyz/playground).

### Streaming

Together AI also supports streaming, this example demonstrates how to use this feature.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{TogetherAIStream}</CodeBlock>
