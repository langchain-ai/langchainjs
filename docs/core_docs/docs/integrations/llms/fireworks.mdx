# Fireworks

You can use models provided by Fireworks AI as follows:

import Fireworks from "@examples/models/llm/fireworks.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Fireworks}</CodeBlock>

Behind the scenes, Fireworks AI uses the OpenAI SDK and OpenAI compatible API, with some caveats:

- Certain properties are not supported by the Fireworks API, see [here](https://readme.fireworks.ai/docs/openai-compatibility#api-compatibility).
- Generation using multiple prompts is not supported.
