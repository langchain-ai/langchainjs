# Fireworks

:::caution
You are currently on a page documenting the use of Fireworks models as [text completion models](/docs/concepts/#llms). Many popular models available on Fireworks are [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/#chat-models).

You may be looking for [this page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/fireworks/).

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community
```

You can use models provided by Fireworks AI as follows:

import Fireworks from "@examples/models/llm/fireworks.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Fireworks}</CodeBlock>

Behind the scenes, Fireworks AI uses the OpenAI SDK and OpenAI compatible API, with some caveats:

- Certain properties are not supported by the Fireworks API, see [here](https://readme.fireworks.ai/docs/openai-compatibility#api-compatibility).
- Generation using multiple prompts is not supported.
