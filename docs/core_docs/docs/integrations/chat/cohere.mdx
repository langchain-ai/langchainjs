# ChatCohere

:::info
The Cohere Chat API is still in beta. This means Cohere may make breaking changes at any time.
:::

## Setup

In order to use the LangChain.js Cohere integration you'll need an API key.
You can sign up for a Cohere account and create an API key [here](https://dashboard.cohere.com/welcome/register).

You'll first need to install the [`@langchain/cohere`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/cohere) package:

:::tip
See [this section for general instructions on installing integration packages](/docs/get_started/installation#installing-integration-packages).
:::

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/cohere
```

## Usage

import BasicExample from "@examples/models/chat/cohere/chat_cohere.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{BasicExample}</CodeBlock>

:::

### Streaming

Cohere's API also supports streaming token responses. The example below demonstrates how to use this feature.

import ChatStreamExample from "@examples/models/chat/cohere/chat_stream_cohere.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ChatStreamExample}</CodeBlock>

### Stateful conversation API

Cohere's chat API supports stateful conversations.
This means the API stores previous chat messages which can be accessed by passing in a `conversation_id` field.
The example below demonstrates how to use this feature.

import StatefulChatExample from "@examples/models/chat/cohere/stateful_conversation.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StatefulChatExample}</CodeBlock>

:::

### RAG

Cohere also comes out of the box with RAG support.
You can pass in documents as context to the API request and Cohere's models will use them when generating responses.

import RAGExample from "@examples/models/chat/cohere/rag.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{RAGExample}</CodeBlock>

:::

### Connectors

The API also allows for other connections which are not static documents.
An example of this is their `web-search` connector which allows you to pass in a query and the API will search the web for relevant documents.
The example below demonstrates how to use this feature.

import ConnectorsExample from "@examples/models/chat/cohere/connectors.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ConnectorsExample}</CodeBlock>

:::

We can see in the `kwargs` object that the API request did a few things:

- Performed a search query, storing the result data in the `searchQueries` and `searchResults` fields. In the `searchQueries` field we see they rephrased our query to `largest penguin species height` for better results.
- Generated three documents from the search query.
- Generated a list of citations
- Generated a final response based on the above actions & content.
