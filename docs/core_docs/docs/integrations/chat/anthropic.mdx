# ChatAnthropic

LangChain supports Anthropic's Claude family of chat models.

## Usage

import AnthropicLegacy from "@examples/models/chat/integration_anthropic_legacy.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{AnthropicLegacy}</CodeBlock>

## ChatAnthropicMessages

LangChain also offers the beta Anthropic Messages endpoint through the new langchain-anthropic package.

You'll first need to install the [`@langchain/anthropic`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/anthropic) package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/anthropic
```

You'll also need to sign up and get an [Anthropic API key](https://www.anthropic.com/).
Set it as an environment variable named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or pass it into the constructor as shown below.

## Usage

You can initialize an instance like this:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Anthropic from "@examples/models/chat/integration_anthropic.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Anthropic}</CodeBlock>
