# Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL Semantic Cache

> The Semantic Cache feature is supported with Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL integration, enabling users to retrieve cached responses based on semantic similarity between the user input and previously cached results. It leverages [AzureCosmosDBNoSQLVectorStore](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/azure_cosmosdb_nosql), which stores vector embeddings of cached prompts. These embeddings enable similarity-based searches, allowing the system to retrieve relevant cached results.

If you don't have an Azure account, you can [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) to get started.

## Setup

You'll first need to install the [`@langchain/azure-cosmosdb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/azure-cosmosdb) package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/azure-cosmosdb @langchain/core
```

You'll also need to have an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL instance running. You can deploy a free version on Azure Portal without any cost, following [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/quickstart-portal).

Once you have your instance running, make sure you have the connection string. If you are using Managed Identity, you need to have the endpoint. You can find them in the Azure Portal, under the "Settings / Keys" section of your instance.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

:::info

When using Azure Managed Identity and role-based access control, you must ensure that the database and container have been created beforehand. RBAC does not provide permissions to create databases and containers. You can get more information about the permission model in the [Azure Cosmos DB documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-setup-rbac#permission-model).

:::

### Storage configuration

By default, this integration will automatically try to create the database and container if they do not exist. You can configure the database and container names in the constructor:

```typescript
import { AzureCosmosDBNoSQLChatMessageHistory } from "@langchain/azure-cosmosdb";

const chatHistory = new AzureCosmosDBNoSQLSemanticCache(embeddings, {
  databaseName: "my_database", // default is "vectorSearchDB"
  containerName: "my_container", // default is "semanticCacheContainer"
});
```

:::important

If you create the container beforehand, make sure to set the partition key to `/id`, as this is required by the integration.

## Usage example

import Example from "@examples/caches/azure_cosmosdb_nosql/azure_cosmosdb_nosql.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>
