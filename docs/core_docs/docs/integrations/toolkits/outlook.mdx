# Outlook Toolkit

## Overview

Using this toolkit, you can integrate Microsoft Graph API functionalities into
your applications to manage email interactions.

## Learn Microsoft Graph

Microsoft Graph is a RESTful web API that enables you to access Microsoft
Cloud service resources. With Microsoft Graph, you can integrate various
Microsoft services and data, including users' emails, calendar, contacts,
and more, into your applications.

After you register your app and get authentication tokens for a user or service,
you can make requests to the Microsoft Graph API.

## Set up

An `accessToken` is needed to use the Outlook Toolkit.

You need to first register an application in Azure Portal to obtain
necessary credentials.

### App register

1. Register an Application:

   - Go to Azure Portal.
   - Navigate to Azure Active Directory -> App registrations.
   - Register a new application, note down the Client ID.

2. Generate Client Secret:

   - In the application settings, go to Certificates & Secrets.
   - Create a new client secret and note down the Client Secret.

3. Configure Redirect URI:

   - In the application settings, go to Authentication.
   - Add a Redirect URI and note down the Redirect URI.

4. Permissions and Admin Consent:
   - In API permissions, grant necessary permissions for Microsoft Graph API or
     Outlook API.
   - Grant admin consent for the added permissions.

At this point, you should have these three credentials:
clientId, clientSecret, redirectUri

Set them as environment variables:

```env
OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
OUTLOOK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
OUTLOOK_REDIRECT_URI=your_redirect_uri
```

**Keep these values secure and avoid exposing them in public repositories.**

### Get an accessToken

Now you are able to use the above credentials to get an `accessToken`.

The `AuthFlowREST` class implements the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow.
You can use the `getAccessToken()` which will open a temporary server on
your `redirectUri` and you need to manually open the printed link to login
on behalf of the user. For every `AuthFlowREST` instance, you only need to
login once. The next time you can run the `getAccessToken()` method, it will
make use of the `refreshToken` obtained together with the first `accessToken`
to get a new `accessToken` without the need of the server and login.

Having the above credentials, you can either pass them to the constructor
or put them in the environment.

```typescript
import { AuthFlowREST } from "@langchain/community/tools/outlook";

const authFlow = new AuthFlowREST();
const authFlow = new AuthFlowREST(clientId, clientSecret, redirectUri);
// Get accessToken
const accessToken = await authFlow.getAccessToken();
// After the above line, you can get the refreshToken
const refreshToken = authFlow.getRefreshToken();
// Get accessToken again without login
const accessToken = await authFlow.getAccessToken();
```

Now you can set the `accessToken` and `refreshToken` as environment variable:

```env
OUTLOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
OUTLOOK_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
```

### Provide accessToken to Outlook Toolkit

The Outlook Toolkit needs `AuthFlowBase` abstarct class to provide accessToken.

```typescript
const authFlow = new AuthFlowREST();
const outlookReadMail = new OutlookReadMailTool(authFlow);
// or simply this when you have the credentials in .env
const outlookReadMail = new OutlookReadMailTool(undefined, "rest");
```

### Other classes to provide accessToken

If you only have a valid `accessToken` in your env, you can use `AuthFlowToken`:

```typescript
const authFlow = new AuthFlowToken(accessToken);
// if you have accessToken stored in .env
const authFlow = new AuthFlowToken();
const outlookReadMail = new OutlookReadMailTool(authFlow);
// or simply this when you have accessToken in .env
const outlookReadMail = new OutlookReadMailTool(undefined, "token");
```

Usually when you obtain a accessToken you also get a refreshToken
used to refresh expired accessToken. The `AuthFlowRefresh` class needs
the following credentials: `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `redirectUri`
and `refreshToken`. In this way you won't need to login, no server
will be open.

```typescript
const authFlow = new AuthFlowRefresh();
const outlookReadMail = new OutlookReadMailTool(authFlow);
// or simply this when you have the credentials in .env
const outlookReadMail = new OutlookReadMailTool(undefined, "refresh");
```

### Customize your own authentication flow

Inherit from `AuthFlowBase` and implement the `getAccessToken()` method.

## Usage

These two examples show how to readand send emails by using agent.
