# Prisma

For augmenting existing models in PostgreSQL database with vector search, Langchain supports using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) together with PostgreSQL and [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) Postgres extension.

## Setup

### Setup database instance with Supabase

Refer to the [Prisma and Supabase integration guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/integrations/prisma) to setup a new database instance with Supabase and Prisma.

### Install Prisma

```bash npm2yarn
npm install prisma
```

### Setup `pgvector` self hosted instance with `docker-compose`

`pgvector` provides a prebuilt Docker image that can be used to quickly setup a self-hosted Postgres instance.

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: ankane/pgvector
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    volumes:
      - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
      - POSTGRES_USER=
      - POSTGRES_DB=

volumes:
  db:
```

### Create a new schema

Assuming you haven't created a schema yet, create a new model with a `vector` field of type `Unsupported("vector")`:

```prisma
model Document {
  id      String                 @id @default(cuid())
  content String
  vector  Unsupported("vector")?
}
```

Afterwards, create a new migration with `--create-only` to avoid running the migration directly.

```bash npm2yarn
npx prisma migrate dev --create-only
```

Add the following line to the newly created migration to enable `pgvector` extension if it hasn't been enabled yet:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```

Run the migration afterwards:

```bash npm2yarn
npx prisma migrate dev
```

## Usage

:::warning
Table names and column names (in fields such as `tableName`, `vectorColumnName`, `columns` and `filter`) are passed into SQL queries directly without parametrisation.
These fields must be sanitized beforehand to avoid SQL injection.
:::

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/prisma_vectorstore/prisma.ts";
import Schema from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/prisma_vectorstore/prisma/schema.prisma";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

The following SQL operators are available as filters: `equals`, `in`, `isNull`, `isNotNull`, `like`, `lt`, `lte`, `gt`, `gte`, `not`.

The samples above uses the following schema:

<CodeBlock language="prisma">{Schema}</CodeBlock>

You can remove `namespace` if you don't need it.
