# Zep Cloud

> [Zep](https://www.getzep.com) is a long-term memory service for AI Assistant apps.
> With Zep, you can provide AI assistants with the ability to recall past conversations, no matter how distant,
> while also reducing hallucinations, latency, and cost.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

**Note:** The `ZepCloudVectorStore` works with `Documents` and is intended to be used as a `Retriever`.
It offers separate functionality to Zep's `ZepCloudMemory` class, which is designed for persisting, enriching
and searching your user's chat history.

## Why Zep's VectorStore? 🤖🚀

Zep automatically embeds documents added to the Zep Vector Store using low-latency models local to the Zep server.
The Zep TS/JS client can be used in non-Node edge environments. These two together with Zep's chat memory functionality
make Zep ideal for building conversational LLM apps where latency and performance are important.

### Supported Search Types

Zep supports both similarity search and Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) search. MMR search is particularly useful
for Retrieval Augmented Generation applications as it re-ranks results to ensure diversity in the returned documents.

## Installation

Sign up for [Zep Cloud](https://app.getzep.com/) and create a project.

Follow the [Zep Cloud Typescript SDK Installation Guide](https://help.getzep.com/sdks) to install and get started with Zep.

## Usage

You'll need your Zep Cloud Project API Key to use the Zep VectorStore. See the [Zep Cloud docs](https://help.getzep.com/projects) for more information.

Zep auto embeds all documents by default, and it's not expecting to receive any embeddings from the user.
Since LangChain requires passing in a `Embeddings` instance, we pass in `FakeEmbeddings`.
