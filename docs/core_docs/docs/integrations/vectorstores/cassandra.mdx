# Cassandra

:::tip Compatibility
Only available on Node.js.
:::

[Apache Cassandra®](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html) is a NoSQL, row-oriented, highly scalable and highly available database.

The [latest version](<https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/CEP-30%3A+Approximate+Nearest+Neighbor(ANN)+Vector+Search+via+Storage-Attached+Indexes>) of Apache Cassandra natively supports Vector Similarity Search.

## Setup

First, install the Cassandra Node.js driver:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install cassandra-driver @langchain/community @langchain/openai
```

Depending on your database providers, the specifics of how to connect to the database will vary. We will create a document `configConnection` which will be used as part of the vector store configuration.

### Apache Cassandra®

Vector search is supported in [Apache Cassandra® 5.0](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/Apache-Cassandra-5.0-Moving-Toward-an-AI-Driven-Future.html) and above. You can use a standard connection document, for example:

```typescript
const configConnection = {
  contactPoints: ['h1', 'h2'],
  localDataCenter: 'datacenter1',
  credentials: {
    username: <...> as string,
    password: <...> as string,
  },
};
```

### Astra DB

Astra DB is a cloud-native Cassandra-as-a-Service platform.

1. Create an [Astra DB account](https://astra.datastax.com/register).
2. Create a [vector enabled database](https://astra.datastax.com/createDatabase).
3. Create a [token](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/manage-application-tokens.html) for your database.

```typescript
const configConnection = {
  serviceProviderArgs: {
    astra: {
      token: <...> as string,
      endpoint: <...> as string,
    },
  },
};
```

Instead of `endpoint:`, you many provide property `datacenterID:` and optionally `regionName:`.

## Indexing docs

```typescript
import { CassandraStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/cassandra";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

// The configConnection document is defined above
const config = {
  ...configConnection,
  keyspace: "test",
  dimensions: 1536,
  table: "test",
  indices: [{ name: "name", value: "(name)" }],
  primaryKey: {
    name: "id",
    type: "int",
  },
  metadataColumns: [
    {
      name: "name",
      type: "text",
    },
  ],
};

const vectorStore = await CassandraStore.fromTexts(
  ["I am blue", "Green yellow purple", "Hello there hello"],
  [
    { id: 2, name: "2" },
    { id: 1, name: "1" },
    { id: 3, name: "3" },
  ],
  new OpenAIEmbeddings(),
  cassandraConfig
);
```

## Querying docs

```typescript
const results = await vectorStore.similaritySearch("Green yellow purple", 1);
```

or filtered query:

```typescript
const results = await vectorStore.similaritySearch("B", 1, { name: "Bubba" });
```

## Vector Types

Cassandra supports `cosine` (the default), `dot_product`, and `euclidean` similarity search; this is defined when the
vector store is first created, and specifed in the constructor parameter `vectorType`, for example:

```typescript
  ...,
  vectorType: "dot_product",
  ...
```

## Indices

With Version 5, Cassandra introduced Storage Attached Indexes, or SAIs. These allow `WHERE` filtering without specifying
the partition key, and allow for additional operator types such as non-equalities. You can define these with the `indices`
parameter, which accepts zero or more dictionaries each containing `name` and `value` entries.

Indices are optional, though required if using filtered queries on non-partition columns.

- The `name` entry is part of the object name; on a table named `test_table` an index with `name: "some_column"`
  would be `idx_test_table_some_column`.
- The `value` entry is the column on which the index is created, surrounded by `(` and `)`. With the above column
  `some_column` it would be specified as `value: "(some_column)"`.
- An optional `options` entry is a map passed to the `WITH OPTIONS =` clause of the `CREATE CUSTOM INDEX` statement.
  The specific entries on this map are index type specific.

```typescript
  indices: [{ name: "some_column", value: "(some_column)" }],
```

## Advanced Filtering

By default, filters are applied with an equality `=`. For those fields that have an `indices` entry, you may
provide an `operator` with a string of a value supported by the index; in this case, you specify one or
more filters, as either a singleton or in a list (which will be `AND`-ed together). For example:

```typescript
   { name: "create_datetime", operator: ">", value: some_datetime_variable }
```

or

```typescript
[
  { userid: userid_variable },
  { name: "create_datetime", operator: ">", value: some_date_variable },
];
```

`value` can be a single value or an array. If it is not an array, or there is only one element in `value`,
the resulting query will be along the lines of `${name} ${operator} ?` with `value` bound to the `?`.

If there is more than one element in the `value` array, the number of unquoted `?` in `name` are counted
and subtracted from the length of `value`, and this number of `?` is put on the right side of the operator;
if there are more than one `?` then they will be encapsulated in `(` and `)`, e.g. `(?, ?, ?)`.

This faciliates bind values on the left of the operator, which is useful for some functions; for example
a geo-distance filter:

```typescript
{
  name: "GEO_DISTANCE(coord, ?)",
  operator: "<",
  value: [new Float32Array([53.3730617,-6.3000515]), 10000],
},
```

## Data Partitioning and Composite Keys

In some systems, you may wish to partition the data for various reasons, perhaps by user or by session. Data in Cassandra
is always partitioned; by default this library will partition by the first primary key field. You may specify multiple
columns which comprise the primary (unique) key of a record, and optionally indicate those fields which should be
part of the partition key. For example, the vector store could be partitioned by both `userid` and `collectionid`, with
additional fields `docid` and `docpart` making an individual entry unique:

```typescript
  ...,
  primaryKey: [
    {name: "userid", type: "text", partition: true},
    {name: "collectionid", type: "text", partition: true},
    {name: "docid", type: "text"},
    {name: "docpart", type: "int"},
  ],
  ...
```

When searching, you may include partition keys on the filter without defining `indices` for these columns; you do
not need to specify all partition keys, but must specify those in the key first. In the above example, you could
specify a filter of `{userid: userid_variable}` and `{userid: userid_variable, collectionid: collectionid_variable}`,
but if you wanted to specify a filter of only `{collectionid: collectionid_variable}` you would have to include
`collectionid` on the `indices` list.

## Additional Configuration Options

In the configuration document, further optional parameters are provided; their defaults are:

```typescript
  ...,
  maxConcurrency: 25,
  batchSize: 1,
  withClause: "",
  ...
```

| Parameter        | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `maxConcurrency` | How many concurrent requests will be sent to Cassandra at a given time.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `batchSize`      | How many documents will be sent on a single request to Cassandra. When using a value > 1, you should ensure your batch size will not exceed the Cassandra parameter `batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb`. Batches are unlogged. |
| `withClause`     | Cassandra tables may be created with an optional `WITH` clause; this is generally not needed but provided for completeness.                                                                                                  |
