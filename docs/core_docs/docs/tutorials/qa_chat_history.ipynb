    "In many Q&A applications we want to allow the user to have a back-and-forth conversation, meaning the application needs some sort of \"memory\" of past questions and answers, and some logic for incorporating those into its current thinking.\n",

    "- [Part 1](/docs/tutorials/rag) introduces RAG and walks through a minimal implementation.\n",

    "1. [Chains](/docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history/#chains), in which we execute at most one retrieval step;\n",
