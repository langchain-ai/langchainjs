# Build a Question/Answering system over SQL data

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Chaining runnables](/docs/how_to/sequence/)
- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)
- [Tools](/docs/concepts/tools)
- [Agents](/docs/concepts/agents)

:::

In this guide we'll go over the basic ways to create a Q&A chain and agent over a SQL database.
These systems will allow us to ask a question about the data in a SQL database and get back a natural language answer.
The main difference between the two is that our agent can query the database in a loop as many time as it needs to answer the question.

## ⚠️ Security note ⚠️

Building Q&A systems of SQL databases can require executing model-generated SQL queries. There are inherent risks in doing this.
Make sure that your database connection permissions are always scoped as narrowly as possible for your chain/agent's needs.
This will mitigate though not eliminate the risks of building a model-driven system. For more on general security best practices, see [here](/docs/security).

## Architecture

At a high-level, the steps of most SQL chain and agent are:

1. **Convert question to SQL query**: Model converts user input to a SQL query.
2. **Execute SQL query**: Execute the SQL query
3. **Answer the question**: Model responds to user input using the query results.

## Setup

First, get required packages and set environment variables:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm i langchain @langchain/community @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

We default to OpenAI models in this guide.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>

# Uncomment the below to use LangSmith. Not required, but recommended for debugging and observability.
# export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your key>
# export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true

# Reduce tracing latency if you are not in a serverless environment
# export LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND=true
```

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import DbCheck from "@examples/use_cases/sql/db_check.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{DbCheck}</CodeBlock>

Great! We've got a SQL database that we can query. Now let's try hooking it up to an LLM.

## Chain

Let's create a simple chain that takes a question, turns it into a SQL query, executes the query, and uses the result to answer the original question.

### Convert question to SQL query

The first step in a SQL chain or agent is to take the user input and convert it to a SQL query. LangChain comes with a built-in chain for this: [`createSqlQueryChain`](https://api.js.langchain.com/functions/langchain.chains_sql_db.createSqlQueryChain.html)

import QuickstartChainExample from "@examples/use_cases/sql/quickstart_chain.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{QuickstartChainExample}</CodeBlock>

We can look at the [LangSmith trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/6d8f0213-9f02-498e-aeb2-ec774e324e2c/r) to get a better understanding of what this chain is doing.
We can also inspect the chain directly for its prompts. Looking at the prompt (below), we can see that it is:

- Dialect-specific. In this case it references SQLite explicitly.
- Has definitions for all the available tables.
- Has three examples rows for each table.

This technique is inspired by papers like [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.00498.pdf), which suggest showing examples rows and being explicit about tables improves performance.
We can also inspect the full prompt via the LangSmith trace:

### Execute SQL query

Now that we've generated a SQL query, we'll want to execute it.
This is the most dangerous part of creating a SQL chain. Consider carefully if it is OK to run automated queries over your data.
Minimize the database connection permissions as much as possible.
Consider adding a human approval step to you chains before query execution (see below).

We can use the [`QuerySqlTool`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.tools_sql.QuerySqlTool.html) to easily add query execution to our chain:

import QuickstartExecuteExample from "@examples/use_cases/sql/quickstart_execute_sql.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{QuickstartExecuteExample}</CodeBlock>

### Answer the question

Now that we have a way to automatically generate and execute queries, we just need to combine the original question and SQL query result to generate a final answer.
We can do this by passing question and result to the LLM once more:

import QuickstartAnswerExample from "@examples/use_cases/sql/quickstart_answer_question.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{QuickstartAnswerExample}</CodeBlock>

### Next steps

For more complex query-generation, we may want to create few-shot prompts or add query-checking steps. For advanced techniques like this and more check out:

- [Prompting strategies](/docs/how_to/sql_prompting): Advanced prompt engineering techniques.
- [Query checking](/docs/how_to/sql_query_checking): Add query validation and error handling.
- [Large databases](/docs/how_to/sql_large_db): Techniques for working with large databases.

## Agents

LangChain offers a number of tools and functions that allow you to create SQL Agents which can provide a more flexible way of interacting with SQL databases. The main advantages of using SQL Agents are:

- It can answer questions based on the databases' schema as well as on the databases' content (like describing a specific table).
- It can recover from errors by running a generated query, catching the traceback and regenerating it correctly.
- It can answer questions that require multiple dependent queries.
- It will save tokens by only considering the schema from relevant tables.
- To initialize the agent, we use [`createOpenAIToolsAgent`](https://api.js.langchain.com/functions/langchain.agents.createOpenAIToolsAgent.html) function.
  This agent contains the [`SqlToolkit`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.agents_toolkits_sql.SqlToolkit.html) which contains tools to:
- Create and execute queries
- Check query syntax
- Retrieve table descriptions
- … and more
