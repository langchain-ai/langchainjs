    "# Build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) App: Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful applications enabled by LLMs is sophisticated question-answering (Q&A) chatbots. These are applications that can answer questions about specific source information. These applications use a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation, or [RAG](/docs/concepts/rag/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a multi-part tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Part 1](/docs/tutorials/rag) (this guide) introduces RAG and walks through a minimal implementation.\n",
    "- [Part 2](/docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history) extends the implementation to accommodate conversation-style interactions and multi-step retrieval processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will show how to build a simple Q&A application\n",
    "over a text data source. Along the way we’ll go over a typical Q&A\n",
    "architecture and highlight additional resources for more advanced Q&A techniques. We’ll also see\n",
    "how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application.\n",
    "LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in\n",
    "complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're already familiar with basic retrieval, you might also be interested in\n",
    "this [high-level overview of different retrieval techniques](/docs/concepts/retrieval).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Here we focus on Q&A for unstructured data. If you are interested for RAG over structured data, check out our tutorial on doing [question/answering over SQL data](/docs/tutorials/sql_qa).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "A typical RAG application has two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. *This usually happens offline.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the indexing portion of this tutorial will largely follow the [semantic search tutorial](/docs/tutorials/retrievers).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing\n",
    "1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. This is done with [Document Loaders](/docs/concepts/document_loaders).\n",
    "2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/concepts/text_splitters) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and passing it into a model, as large chunks are harder to search over and won't fit in a model's finite context window.\n",
    "3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can be searched over later. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/concepts/vectorstores) and [Embeddings](/docs/concepts/embedding_models) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "![index_diagram](../../static/img/rag_indexing.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieval and generation\n",
    "4. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/concepts/retrievers).\n",
    "5. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/concepts/chat_models) / [LLM](/docs/concepts/text_llms) produces an answer using a prompt that includes both the question with the retrieved data\n",
    "\n",
    "![retrieval_diagram](../../static/img/rag_retrieval_generation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've indexed our data, we will use [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/) as our orchestration framework to implement the retrieval and generation steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). Going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them. See [here](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions on how to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide requires the following dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{=mdx}\n",
    "import Npm2Yarn from '@theme/Npm2Yarn';\n",
    "\n",
    "<Npm2Yarn>\n",
    "  langchain @langchain/core @langchain/langgraph\n",
    "</Npm2Yarn>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, see our [Installation guide](/docs/how_to/installation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangSmith\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\n",
    "As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\n",
    "The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",

CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.Another quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning.

The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.In a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:A complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.Chain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks.
