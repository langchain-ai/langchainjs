You can access this version of the tutorial in the [v0.2 docs](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/chatbot/).\n",

        "\n",
        "We'll go over an example of how to design and implement an LLM-powered chatbot. \n",
        "This chatbot will be able to have a conversation and remember previous interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that this chatbot that we build will only use the language model to have a conversation.\n",

        "- [Conversational RAG](/docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history): Enable a chatbot experience over an external source of data\n",

        "## Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "This guide (and most of the other guides in the documentation) uses [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and assumes the reader is as well. Jupyter notebooks are perfect for learning how to work with LLM systems because oftentimes things can go wrong (unexpected output, API down, etc) and going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them.\n",
        "\n",
        "This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebook. See [here](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions on how to install.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Installation\n",
        "\n",
        "For this tutorial we will need `@langchain/core` and `langgraph`:\n",
        "\n",
        "```{=mdx}\n",
        "import Npm2Yarn from \"@theme/Npm2Yarn\"\n",
        "\n",

        "</Npm2Yarn>\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "For more details, see our [Installation guide](/docs/how_to/installation).\n",
        "\n",
        "### LangSmith\n",
        "\n",
        "Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\n",
        "As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\n",
        "The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).\n",
        "\n",
        "After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\n",
