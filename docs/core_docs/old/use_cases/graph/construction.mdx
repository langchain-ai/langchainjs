# Constructing knowledge graphs

In this guide we’ll go over the basic ways of constructing a knowledge
graph based on unstructured text. The constructured graph can then be
used as knowledge base in a RAG application. At a high-level, the steps
of constructing a knowledge are from text are:

1.  Extracting structured information from text: Model is used to
    extract structured graph information from text.
2.  Storing into graph database: Storing the extracted structured graph
    information into a graph database enables downstream RAG
    applications

## Setup

#### Install dependencies

```mdx-code-block
import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";
import Npm2Yarn from "@theme/Npm2Yarn";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

<Npm2Yarn>
  langchain @langchain/community @langchain/openai neo4j-driver zod
</Npm2Yarn>
```

#### Set environment variables

We’ll use OpenAI in this example:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Optional, use LangSmith for best-in-class observability
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your-api-key
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
```

Next, we need to define Neo4j credentials. Follow [these installation
steps](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/)
to set up a Neo4j database.

```env
NEO4J_URI="bolt://localhost:7687"
NEO4J_USERNAME="neo4j"
NEO4J_PASSWORD="password"
```

The below example will create a connection with a Neo4j database.

```typescript
import "neo4j-driver";
import { Neo4jGraph } from "@langchain/community/graphs/neo4j_graph";

const url = Deno.env.get("NEO4J_URI");
const username = Deno.env.get("NEO4J_USER");
const password = Deno.env.get("NEO4J_PASSWORD");
const graph = await Neo4jGraph.initialize({ url, username, password });
```

## LLM Graph Transformer

Extracting graph data from text enables the transformation of
unstructured information into structured formats, facilitating deeper
insights and more efficient navigation through complex relationships and
patterns. The LLMGraphTransformer converts text documents into
structured graph documents by leveraging a LLM to parse and categorize
entities and their relationships. The selection of the LLM model
significantly influences the output by determining the accuracy and
nuance of the extracted graph data.

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { LLMGraphTransformer } from "@langchain/community/experimental/graph_transformers/llm";

const model = new ChatOpenAI({
  temperature: 0,
  model: "gpt-4-turbo-preview",
});

const llmGraphTransformer = new LLMGraphTransformer({
  llm: model,
});
```

Now we can pass in example text and examine the results.

```typescript
import { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";

let text = `
Marie Curie, was a Polish and naturalised-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity.
She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win a Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two scientific fields.
Her husband, Pierre Curie, was a co-winner of her first Nobel Prize, making them the first-ever married couple to win the Nobel Prize and launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes.
She was, in 1906, the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.
`;

const result = await llmGraphTransformer.convertToGraphDocuments([
  new Document({ pageContent: text }),
]);

console.log(`Nodes: ${result[0].nodes.length}`);
console.log(`Relationships:${result[0].relationships.length}`);
```

```text
Nodes: 8
Relationships:7
```

Note that the graph construction process is non-deterministic since we
are using LLM. Therefore, you might get slightly different results on
each execution. Examine the following image to better grasp the
structure of the generated knowledge graph.

<figure>
  <img
    src="../../../../static/img/graph_construction1.png"
    alt="graph_construction1.png"
  />
  <figcaption aria-hidden="true">graph_construction1.png</figcaption>
</figure>

Additionally, you have the flexibility to define specific types of nodes
and relationships for extraction according to your requirements.

```typescript
const llmGraphTransformerFiltered = new LLMGraphTransformer({
  llm: model,
  allowedNodes: ["PERSON", "COUNTRY", "ORGANIZATION"],
  allowedRelationships: ["NATIONALITY", "LOCATED_IN", "WORKED_AT", "SPOUSE"],
  strictMode: false,
});

const result_filtered =
  await llmGraphTransformerFiltered.convertToGraphDocuments([
    new Document({ pageContent: text }),
  ]);

console.log(`Nodes: ${result_filtered[0].nodes.length}`);
console.log(`Relationships:${result_filtered[0].relationships.length}`);
```

```text
Nodes: 6
Relationships:4
```

For a better understanding of the generated graph, we can again
visualize it.

<figure>
  <img
    src="../../../../static/img/graph_construction2.png"
    alt="graph_construction1.png"
  />
  <figcaption aria-hidden="true">graph_construction1.png</figcaption>
</figure>

## Storing to graph database

The generated graph documents can be stored to a graph database using
the `addGraphDocuments` method.

```typescript
await graph.addGraphDocuments(result_filtered);
```
