When working with files, like PDFs, you’re likely to encounter text that
exceeds your language model’s context window. To process this text,
consider these strategies:

1.  **Change LLM** Choose a different LLM that supports a larger context
    window.
2.  **Brute Force** Chunk the document, and extract content from each
    chunk.
3.  **RAG** Chunk the document, index the chunks, and only extract
    content from a subset of chunks that look “relevant”.

Keep in mind that these strategies have different trade offs and the
best strategy likely depends on the application that you’re designing!

## Set up

First, let’s install some required dependencies:

```mdx-code-block
import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";
import Npm2Yarn from "@theme/Npm2Yarn";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

<Npm2Yarn>
  @langchain/openai zod cheerio
</Npm2Yarn>
```

Next, we need some example data! Let’s download an article about [cars
from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car) and load it as a
LangChain `Document`.

```typescript
import { CheerioWebBaseLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/web/cheerio";
// Only required in a Deno notebook environment to load the peer dep.
import "cheerio";

const loader = new CheerioWebBaseLoader("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car");

const docs = await loader.load();
```

```text
[Module: null prototype] {
  contains: [Function: contains],
  default: [Function: initialize] {
    contains: [Function: contains],
    html: [Function: html],
    merge: [Function: merge],
    parseHTML: [Function: parseHTML],
    root: [Function: root],
    text: [Function: text],
    xml: [Function: xml],
    load: [Function: load],
    _root: Document {
      parent: null,
      prev: null,
      next: null,
      startIndex: null,
      endIndex: null,
      children: [],
      type: "root"
    },
    _options: { xml: false, decodeEntities: true },
    fn: Cheerio {}
  },
  html: [Function: html],
  load: [Function: load],
  merge: [Function: merge],
  parseHTML: [Function: parseHTML],
  root: [Function: root],
  text: [Function: text],
  xml: [Function: xml]
}
```

```typescript
docs[0].pageContent.length;
```

```text
95865
```

## Define the schema

Here, we’ll define schema to extract key developments from the text.

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const keyDevelopmentSchema = z
  .object({
    year: z
      .number()
      .describe("The year when there was an important historic development."),
    description: z
      .string()
      .describe("What happened in this year? What was the development?"),
    evidence: z
      .string()
      .describe(
        "Repeat verbatim the sentence(s) from which the year and description information were extracted"
      ),
  })
  .describe("Information about a development in the history of cars.");

const extractionDataSchema = z
  .object({
    key_developments: z.array(keyDevelopmentSchema),
  })
  .describe(
    "Extracted information about key developments in the history of cars"
  );

const SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = [
  "You are an expert at identifying key historic development in text.",
  "Only extract important historic developments. Extract nothing if no important information can be found in the text.",
].join("\n");

// Define a custom prompt to provide instructions and any additional context.
// 1) You can add examples into the prompt template to improve extraction quality
// 2) Introduce additional parameters to take context into account (e.g., include metadata
//    about the document from which the text was extracted.)
const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  ["system", SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE],
  // Keep on reading through this use case to see how to use examples to improve performance
  // MessagesPlaceholder('examples'),
  ["human", "{text}"],
]);

// We will be using tool calling mode, which
// requires a tool calling capable model.
const llm = new ChatOpenAI({
  model: "gpt-4-0125-preview",
  temperature: 0,
});

const extractionChain = prompt.pipe(
  llm.withStructuredOutput(extractionDataSchema)
);
```

## Brute force approach

Split the documents into chunks such that each chunk fits into the
context window of the LLMs.

```typescript
import { TokenTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";

const textSplitter = new TokenTextSplitter({
  chunkSize: 2000,
  chunkOverlap: 20,
});

// Note that this method takes an array of docs
const splitDocs = await textSplitter.splitDocuments(docs);
```

Use the `.batch` method present on all runnables to run the extraction
in **parallel** across each chunk!

:::tip

You can often use `.batch()` to parallelize the extractions!

If your model is exposed via an API, this will likely speed up your
extraction flow.

:::

```typescript
// Limit just to the first 3 chunks
// so the code can be re-run quickly
const firstFewTexts = splitDocs.slice(0, 3).map((doc) => doc.pageContent);

const extractionChainParams = firstFewTexts.map((text) => {
  return { text };
});

const results = await extractionChain.batch(extractionChainParams, {
  maxConcurrency: 5,
});
```

### Merge results

After extracting data from across the chunks, we’ll want to merge the
extractions together.

```typescript
const keyDevelopments = results.flatMap((result) => result.key_developments);

keyDevelopments.slice(0, 20);
```

```text
[
  { year: 0, description: "", evidence: "" },
  {
    year: 1769,
    description: "French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle.",
    evidence: "French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769."
  },
  {
    year: 1808,
    description: "French-born Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combu"... 25 more characters,
    evidence: "French-born Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combu"... 33 more characters
  },
  {
    year: 1886,
    description: "German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen, inventing the modern car—a practical,"... 40 more characters,
    evidence: "The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886, when German"... 56 more characters
  },
  {
    year: 1908,
    description: "The 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company, became one of the first ca"... 28 more characters,
    evidence: "One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by"... 24 more characters
  }
]
```

## RAG based approach

Another simple idea is to chunk up the text, but instead of extracting
information from every chunk, just focus on the the most relevant
chunks.

:::caution

It can be difficult to identify which chunks are relevant.

For example, in the `car` article we’re using here, most of the article
contains key development information. So by using **RAG**, we’ll likely
be throwing out a lot of relevant information.

We suggest experimenting with your use case and determining whether this
approach works or not.

:::

Here’s a simple example that relies on an in-memory demo
`MemoryVectorStore` vectorstore.

```typescript
import { MemoryVectorStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/memory";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

// Only load the first 10 docs for speed in this demo use-case
const vectorstore = await MemoryVectorStore.fromDocuments(
  splitDocs.slice(0, 10),
  new OpenAIEmbeddings()
);

// Only extract from top document
const retriever = vectorstore.asRetriever({ k: 1 });
```

In this case the RAG extractor is only looking at the top document.

```typescript
import { RunnableSequence } from "@langchain/core/runnables";

const ragExtractor = RunnableSequence.from([
  {
    text: retriever.pipe((docs) => docs[0].pageContent),
  },
  extractionChain,
]);
```

```typescript
const results = await ragExtractor.invoke(
  "Key developments associated with cars"
);
```

```typescript
results.key_developments;
```

```text
[
  {
    year: 2020,
    description: "The lifetime of a car built in the 2020s is expected to be about 16 years, or about 2 million km (1."... 33 more characters,
    evidence: "The lifetime of a car built in the 2020s is expected to be about 16 years, or about 2 millionkm (1.2"... 31 more characters
  },
  {
    year: 2030,
    description: "All fossil fuel vehicles will be banned in Amsterdam from 2030.",
    evidence: "all fossil fuel vehicles will be banned in Amsterdam from 2030."
  },
  {
    year: 2020,
    description: "In 2020, there were 56 million cars manufactured worldwide, down from 67 million the previous year.",
    evidence: "In 2020, there were 56 million cars manufactured worldwide, down from 67 million the previous year."
  }
]
```

## Common issues

Different methods have their own pros and cons related to cost, speed,
and accuracy.

Watch out for these issues:

- Chunking content means that the LLM can fail to extract information
  if the information is spread across multiple chunks.
- Large chunk overlap may cause the same information to be extracted
  twice, so be prepared to de-duplicate!
- LLMs can make up data. If looking for a single fact across a large
  text and using a brute force approach, you may end up getting more
  made up data.
