This walkthrough uses a basic, unoptimized implementation called MemoryVectorStore that stores embeddings in-memory and does an exact, linear search for the most similar embeddings.

## Usage

### Create a new index from texts

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import ExampleTexts from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/memory.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleTexts}</CodeBlock>

### Create a new index from a loader

import ExampleLoader from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/memory_fromdocs.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleLoader}</CodeBlock>

Here is the current base interface all vector stores share:

```typescript
interface VectorStore {
  /**
   * Add more documents to an existing VectorStore.
   * Some providers support additional parameters, e.g. to associate custom ids
   * with added documents or to change the batch size of bulk inserts.
   * Returns an array of ids for the documents or nothing.
   */
  addDocuments(
    documents: Document[],
    options?: Record<string, any>
  ): Promise<string[] | void>;

  /**
   * Search for the most similar documents to a query
   */
  similaritySearch(
    query: string,
    k?: number,
    filter?: object | undefined
  ): Promise<Document[]>;

  /**
   * Search for the most similar documents to a query,
   * and return their similarity score
   */
  similaritySearchWithScore(
    query: string,
    k = 4,
    filter: object | undefined = undefined
  ): Promise<[object, number][]>;

  /**
   * Turn a VectorStore into a Retriever
   */
  asRetriever(k?: number): BaseRetriever;

  /**
   * Delete embedded documents from the vector store matching the passed in parameter.
   * Not supported by every provider.
   */
  delete(params?: Record<string, any>): Promise<void>;

  /**
   * Advanced: Add more documents to an existing VectorStore,
   * when you already have their embeddings
   */
  addVectors(
    vectors: number[][],
    documents: Document[],
    options?: Record<string, any>
  ): Promise<string[] | void>;

  /**
   * Advanced: Search for the most similar documents to a query,
   * when you already have the embedding of the query
   */
  similaritySearchVectorWithScore(
    query: number[],
    k: number,
    filter?: object
  ): Promise<[Document, number][]>;
}
```

You can create a vector store from a list of [Documents](/docs/api/document/classes/Document), or from a list of texts and their corresponding metadata. You can also create a vector store from an existing index, the signature of this method depends on the vector store you're using, check the documentation of the vector store you're interested in.

```typescript
abstract class BaseVectorStore implements VectorStore {
  static fromTexts(
    texts: string[],
    metadatas: object[] | object,
    embeddings: Embeddings,
    dbConfig: Record<string, any>
  ): Promise<VectorStore>;

  static fromDocuments(
    docs: Document[],
    embeddings: Embeddings,
    dbConfig: Record<string, any>
  ): Promise<VectorStore>;
}
```

## Which one to pick?

Here's a quick guide to help you pick the right vector store for your use case:

- If you're after something that can just run inside your Node.js application, in-memory, without any other servers to stand up, then go for [HNSWLib](./integrations/hnswlib), [Faiss](./integrations/faiss), or [LanceDB](./integrations/lancedb)
- If you're looking for something that can run in-memory in browser-like environments, then go for [MemoryVectorStore](./integrations/memory)
- If you come from Python and you were looking for something similar to FAISS, try [HNSWLib](./integrations/hnswlib) or [Faiss](./integrations/faiss)
- If you're looking for an open-source full-featured vector database that you can run locally in a docker container, then go for [Chroma](./integrations/chroma)
- If you're looking for an open-source vector database that offers low-latency, local embedding of documents and supports apps on the edge, then go for [Zep](./integrations/zep)
- If you're looking for an open-source production-ready vector database that you can run locally (in a docker container) or hosted in the cloud, then go for [Weaviate](./integrations/weaviate).
- If you're using Supabase already then look at the [Supabase](./integrations/supabase) vector store to use the same Postgres database for your embeddings too
- If you're looking for a production-ready vector store you don't have to worry about hosting yourself, then go for [Pinecone](./integrations/pinecone)
- If you are already utilizing SingleStore, or if you find yourself in need of a distributed, high-performance database, you might want to consider the [SingleStore](./integrations/singlestore) vector store.
- If you are looking for an online MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) data warehousing service, you might want to consider the [AnalyticDB](./integrations/analyticdb) vector store.
