# Events / Callbacks

LangChain provides a callback system that allows you to hook into the various stages of your LLM application. This is useful for logging, [monitoring](./tracing), [streaming](../modules/models/llms/additional_functionality#streaming-responses), and other tasks.

You can subscribe to these events by using the `callbacks` argument available throughout the API. This method accepts a list of handler objects, which are expected to implement one or more of the methods described in the [API docs](../api/callbacks/interfaces/CallbackHandlerMethods).

## How to use callbacks

The `callbacks` argument is available on most objects throughout the API (Chains, Models, Tools, Agents, etc.) in two different places:

- **Constructor callbacks**: defined in the constructor, eg. `new LLMChain({ callbacks: [handler] })`, which will be used for all calls made on that object, and will be scoped to that object only, ie doen't affect any child object, eg. if you pass a handler to the LLMChain constructor, it will not be used by the Model attached to that chain.
- **Request callbacks**: defined in the `call()`/`run()`/`apply()` methods used for issuing a request, eg. `chain.call({ input: '...' }, [handler])`, which will be used for that specific request only, and all sub-requests that it contains (eg. a call to an LLMChain triggers a call to a Model, which uses the same handler passed in the `call()` method).

The `verbose` argument is available on most objects throughout the API (Chains, Models, Tools, Agents, etc.) as a constructor argument, eg. `new LLMChain({ verbose: true })`, and it is equivalent to passing a `ConsoleCallbackHandler` to the `callbacks` argument of that object and all child objects. This is useful for debugging, as it will log all events to the console.

### When do you want to use each of these?

- Constructor callbacks are most useful for use cases such as logging, monitoring, etc., which are _not specific to a single request_, but rather to the entire chain. For example, if you want to log all the requests made to an LLMChain, you would pass a handler to the constructor.
- Request callbacks are most useful for use cases such as streaming, where you want to stream the output of a single request to a specific websocket connection, or other similar use cases. For example, if you want to stream the output of a single request to a websocket, you would pass a handler to the `call()` method

## Using an existing handler

LangChain provides a few built-in handlers that you can use to get started. These are available in the `langchain/callbacks` module. The most basic handler is the `ConsoleCallbackHandler`, which simply logs all events to the console. In the future we will add more default handlers to the library. Note that when the `verbose` flag on the object is set to `true`, the `ConsoleCallbackHandler` will be invoked even without being explicitly passed in.

import ConsoleExample from "@examples/callbacks/console_handler.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ConsoleExample}</CodeBlock>

## Creating a one-off handler

You can create a one-off handler inline by passing a plain object to the `callbacks` argument. This object should implement the [`CallbackHandlerMethods`](../api/callbacks/interfaces/CallbackHandlerMethods) interface. This is useful if eg. you need to create a handler that you will use only for a single request, eg to stream the output of an LLM/Agent/etc to a websocket.

import StreamingExample from "@examples/models/llm/llm_streaming.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StreamingExample}</CodeBlock>

## Using multiple handlers

We offer a method on the `CallbackManager` class that allows you to create a one-off handler. This is useful if eg. you need to create a handler that you will use only for a single request, eg to stream the output of an LLM/Agent/etc to a websocket.

This is a more complete example that passes a `CallbackManager` to a ChatModel, and LLMChain, a Tool, and an Agent.

import AgentExample from "@examples/agents/streaming.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{AgentExample}</CodeBlock>

## Creating a custom handler

You can also create your own handler by implementing the `BaseCallbackHandler` interface. This is useful if you want to do something more complex than just logging to the console, eg. send the events to a logging service. As an example here is a simple implementation of a handler that logs to the console:

import CustomHandlerExample from "@examples/callbacks/custom_handler.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{CustomHandlerExample}</CodeBlock>

You could then use it as described in the [section](#using-an-existing-handler) above.
