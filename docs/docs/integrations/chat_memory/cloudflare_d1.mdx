# Cloudflare D1-Backed Chat Memory

:::info
This integration is only supported in Cloudflare Workers.
:::

For longer-term persistence across chat sessions, you can swap out the default in-memory `chatHistory` that backs chat memory classes like `BufferMemory` for a Cloudflare D1 instance.

## Setup

If you are using TypeScript, you may need to install Cloudflare types if they aren't already present:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -S @cloudflare/workers-types
```

Set up a D1 instance for your worker by following [the official documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/). Your project's `wrangler.toml` file should
look something like this:

```toml
name = "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2023-09-18"

[vars]
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "YOUR_ANTHROPIC_KEY"

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"                                       # available in your Worker as env.DB
database_name = "YOUR_D1_DB_NAME"
database_id = "YOUR_D1_DB_ID"
```

## Usage

You can then use D1 to store your history as follows:

import Example from "@examples/memory/cloudflare_d1.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>
