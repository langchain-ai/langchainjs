# Cloudflare Vectorize

If you're deploying your project in a Cloudflare worker, you can use [Cloudflare Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/) with LangChain.js.
It's a powerful and convenient option that's built directly into Cloudflare.

## Setup

:::tip Compatibility
Cloudflare Vectorize is currently in open beta, and requires a Cloudflare account on a paid plan to use.
:::

After [setting up your project](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/get-started/intro/#prerequisites),
create an index by running the following Wrangler command:

```bash
$ npx wrangler vectorize create <index_name> --preset @cf/baai/bge-small-en-v1.5
```

You can see a full list of options for the `vectorize` command [in the official documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#vectorize).

You'll then need to update your `wrangler.toml` file to include an entry for `[[vectorize]]`:

```toml
[[vectorize]]
binding = "VECTORIZE_INDEX"
index_name = "<index_name>"
```

## Usage

Below is an example worker that adds documents to a vectorstore, queries it, or clears it depending on the path used. It also uses [Cloudflare Workers AI Embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/cloudflare_ai).

:::note
If running locally, be sure to run wrangler as `npx wrangler dev --remote`!
:::

```toml
name = "langchain-test"
main = "worker.js"
compatibility_date = "2023-09-22"

[[vectorize]]
binding = "VECTORIZE_INDEX"
index_name = "langchain-test"

[ai]
binding = "AI"
```
