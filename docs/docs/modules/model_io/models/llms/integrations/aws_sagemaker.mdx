# AWS SageMakerEndpoint

LangChain.js supports integration with AWS SageMaker-hosted endpoints. Check [Amazon SageMaker JumpStart](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/jumpstart/) for a list of available models, and how to deploy your own.

## Setup

You'll need to install the official SageMaker SDK as a peer dependency:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @aws-sdk/client-sagemaker-runtime
```

## Usage

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import SageMakerEndpointExample from "@examples/models/llm/sagemaker_endpoint.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{SageMakerEndpointExample}</CodeBlock>
