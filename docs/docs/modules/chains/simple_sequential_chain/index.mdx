# SequentialChain

Sequential chains allow you to connect multiple chains and compose them into pipelines that execute some specific scenario.

## SimpleSequentialChain

Let's start with the simplest possible case which is `SimpleSequentialChain`.

An `SimpleSequentialChain` is a chain that allows you to join multiple single-input/single-output chains into one chain.

The example below shows a sample usecase. In the first step, given a title, a synopsis of a play is generated. In the second step, based on the generated synopsis, a review of the play is generated.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{SimpleSequentialChainExample}</CodeBlock>

## SequentialChain

More advanced scenario assumes you have multiple chains that have more than one input or ouput.
