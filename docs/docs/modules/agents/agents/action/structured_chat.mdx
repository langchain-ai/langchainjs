# Structured Tool Chat Agent

Structured Tool Chat Agents are designed to work with tools that take an input conforming to an arbitrary object schema, in contrast to other agents that only support tools that take a single string as input.

This makes it easier to create and use tools that require multiple input values - rather than prompting for a stringified object or comma separated list, you can specify an object with multiple keys.
Here's an example with a `DynamicStructuredTool`:

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>
