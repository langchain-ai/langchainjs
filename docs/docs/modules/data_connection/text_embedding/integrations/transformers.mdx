# HuggingFace Transformers

The `TransformerEmbeddings` class uses the [Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/index) package to generate embeddings for a given text.

It runs locally and even works directly in the browser, allowing you to create web apps with built-in embeddings.

## Setup

You'll need to install the [@xenova/transformers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xenova/transformers) package as a peer dependency:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @xenova/transformers
```

## Example

Note that if you're using in a browser context, you'll likely want to put all inference-related code in a web worker to avoid
blocking the main thread.

See [this guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/tutorials/next) and the other resources in the Transformers.js docs for an idea of how to
set up your project.
