# AzureSearch

:::tip Compatibility
Only available on Node.js.

[Azure Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/cognitive-search/) is a distributed, RESTful search engine optimized for speed and relevance on production-scale workloads on Azure. It supports also vector search using the [k-nearest neighbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) (kNN) algorithm and also [semantic search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/semantic-search-overview).
You can read more about the support of vector search in Azure Cognitive Search [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-ranking).

You can also use this vector store integration for full text search, vector search and hybrid search.

Learn how to leverage the vector search capabilities of Azure Cognitive Search from [this page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-overview)

LangChain.js accepts [@azure/search-documents](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js) as the client for Azure Search vectorstore. Unfortunately, the features used to implement the vector store are available only in beta version of the package.

## Setup

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -S @azure/search-documents@12.0.0-beta.3
```

You'll also need to have an Azure Search instance running. You can deploy a free version on Azure Portal without any cost.
To use here you will need the Endpoint and the Admin Key (Query key can be used only to search document, not to index, update or delete).

## Example: index docs, vector search and LLM integration

Below is an example that indexes 4 documents in Azure Search,
runs a vector search query, and finally uses an LLM to answer a question in natural language
based on the retrieved documents.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import FromDocs from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/azuresearch/azuresearch.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{FromDocs}</CodeBlock>
