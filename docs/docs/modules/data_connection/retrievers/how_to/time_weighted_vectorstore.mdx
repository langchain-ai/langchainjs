# Time-weighted vector store retriever

This retriever uses a combination of semantic similarity and a time decay.

The algorithm for scoring them is:

```
semantic_similarity + (1.0 - decay_rate) ^ hours_passed
```

Notably, `hours_passed` refers to the hours passed since the object in the retriever **was last accessed**, not since it was created. This means that frequently accessed objects remain "fresh."

```typescript
let score = (1.0 - this.decayRate) ** hoursPassed + vectorRelevance;
```

`this.decayRate` is a configurable decimal number between 0 and 1. A lower number means that documents will be "remembered" for longer, while a higher number strongly weights more recently accessed documents.

Note that setting a decay rate of exactly 0 or 1 makes `hoursPassed` irrelevant and makes this retriever equivalent to a standard vector lookup.

## Usage

This example shows how to intialize a `TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever` with a vector store.
It is important to note that due to required metadata, all documents must be added to the backing vector store using the `addDocuments` method on the **retriever**, not the vector store itself.
