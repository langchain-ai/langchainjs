# Pairwise String Comparison

Often you will want to compare predictions of an LLM, Chain, or Agent for a given input. The `StringComparison` evaluators facilitate this so you can answer questions like:

- Which LLM or prompt produces a preferred output for a given question?
- Which examples should I include for few-shot example selection?
- Which output is better to include for fintetuning?

The simplest and often most reliable automated way to choose a preferred prediction for a given input is to use the `labeled_pairwise_string` evaluator.

## Methods

The pairwise string evaluator can be called using **evaluateStringPairs** methods, which accept:

- prediction (string) – The predicted response of the first model, chain, or prompt.
- predictionB (string) – The predicted response of the second model, chain, or prompt.
- input (string) – The input question, prompt, or other text.
- reference (string) – (Only for the labeled_pairwise_string variant) The reference response.

They return a dictionary with the following values:

- value: 'A' or 'B', indicating whether `prediction` or `predictionB` is preferred, respectively
- score: Integer 0 or 1 mapped from the 'value', where a score of 1 would mean that the first `prediction` is preferred, and a score of 0 would mean `predictionB` is preferred.
- reasoning: String "chain of thought reasoning" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score

## Without References

When references aren't available, you can still predict the preferred response.
The results will reflect the evaluation model's preference, which is less reliable and may result
in preferences that are factually incorrect.

## Defining the Criteria

By default, the LLM is instructed to select the 'preferred' response based on helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth of thought. You can customize the criteria by passing in a `criteria` argument, where the criteria could take any of the following forms:

- `Criteria` - to use one of the default criteria and their descriptions
- `Constitutional principal` - use one any of the constitutional principles defined in langchain
- `Dictionary`: a list of custom criteria, where the key is the name of the criteria, and the value is the description.

Below is an example for determining preferred writing responses based on a custom style.

## Customize the LLM

By default, the loader uses `gpt-4` in the evaluation chain. You can customize this when loading.

## Customize the Evaluation Prompt

You can use your own custom evaluation prompt to add more task-specific instructions or to instruct the evaluator to score the output.

_Note:_ If you use a prompt that expects generates a result in a unique format, you may also have to pass in a custom output parser (`outputParser=yourParser()`) instead of the default `PairwiseStringResultOutputParser`
