# Auto-generated API documentation for LangChainJS

Do not edit the contents of this directory directly.

## Usage

To build the API refs run `yarn build` from the root of this directory, then `yarn dev` or `yarn start` to serve the docs locally.
This app uses [Typedoc](https://typedoc.org/) to generate API references from the source code. The generated HTML is then placed inside the `/public` directory, which is served by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
There is a default redirect when requests are made to `/` which redirects to `/index.html`.

The API references are gitignored by default, so they will not be committed to the repo.
