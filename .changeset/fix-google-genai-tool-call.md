fix: handle "tool_call" content blocks in ChatGoogleGenerativeAI with outputVersion: "v1"

Previously, using `outputVersion: "v1"` with `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` would throw an "Unknown content type tool_call" error when processing tool calls generated by LangChain's `AIMessage`. This fix adds a handler for the `tool_call` block type in the conversion utility, ensuring compatibility with standard LangChain tool call blocks.
