feat(google): add `@langchain/google` -- unified Google/Gemini integration

New package that replaces the fragmented `@langchain/google-genai` / `@langchain/google-common` / Vertex AI package stack with a single integration.

Published as 0.1.0 (early release). Existing Google packages will continue to receive maintenance updates.
