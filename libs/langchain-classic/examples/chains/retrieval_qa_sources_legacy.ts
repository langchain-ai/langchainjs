One of our nation’s top legal minds who will continue in just Brey- — Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence. A former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender from a family of public-school educators and police officers — she’s a consensus builder.\n\nSince she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support, including the Fraternal Order of Police and former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.",

At our border, we’ve installed new technology, like cutting-edge scanners, to better detect drug smuggling.\n\nWe’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.\n\nWe’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges in significant larger number so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases — cases heard faster — and those who aren’t legitimately here can be sent back.",
