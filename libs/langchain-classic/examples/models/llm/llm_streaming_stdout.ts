/*
Verse 1
Crystal clear and made with care
Sparkling water on my lips, so refreshing in the air
Fizzy bubbles, light and sweet
My favorite beverage I can’t help but repeat

Chorus
A toast to sparkling water, I’m feeling so alive
Let’s take a sip, and let’s take a drive
A toast to sparkling water, it’s the best I’ve had in my life
It’s the best way to start off the night

Verse 2
It’s the perfect drink to quench my thirst
It’s the best way to stay hydrated, it’s the first
A few ice cubes, a splash of lime
It will make any day feel sublime
