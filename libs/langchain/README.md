LangChain is a framework for building LLM-powered applications. It helps you chain together interoperable components and third-party integrations to simplify AI application development — all while future-proofing decisions as the underlying technology evolves.

**Documentation**: To learn more about LangChain, check out [the docs](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langchain/overview).

If you're looking for more advanced customization or agent orchestration, check out [LangGraph.js](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/). our framework for building agents and controllable workflows.

## ⚡️ Quick Install

You can use npm, pnpm, or yarn to install LangChain.js

`npm install -S langchain` or `pnpm install langchain` or `yarn add langchain`

## 🚀 Why use LangChain?

LangChain helps developers build applications powered by LLMs through a standard interface for agents, models, embeddings, vector stores, and more.

Use LangChain for:

- **Real-time data augmentation**. Easily connect LLMs to diverse data sources and external/internal systems, drawing from LangChain’s vast library of integrations with model providers, tools, vector stores, retrievers, and more.
- **Model interoperability**. Swap models in and out as your engineering team experiments to find the best choice for your application’s needs. As the industry frontier evolves, adapt quickly — LangChain’s abstractions keep you moving without losing momentum.

## 📦 LangChain's ecosystem

- [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith) - Unified developer platform for building, testing, and monitoring LLM applications. With LangSmith, you can debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain visibility in production, and deploy agents with confidence.
- [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview) - Build agents that can reliably handle complex tasks with LangGraph, our low-level agent orchestration framework. LangGraph offers customizable architecture, long-term memory, and human-in-the-loop workflows — and is trusted in production by companies like LinkedIn, Uber, Klarna, and GitLab.
