# @langchain/mixedbread-ai

This package contains the LangChain.js integrations for the [Mixedbread AI API](https://mixedbread.ai/).

## Installation

```bash
npm install @langchain/mixedbread-ai
```

This package, along with the main LangChain package, depends on [`@langchain/core`](https://npmjs.com/package/@langchain/core/). If you are using this package with other LangChain packages, you should make sure that all of the packages depend on the same instance of `@langchain/core`.

## Authentication

To use this package, you need a Mixedbread AI API key. You can obtain your API key by signing up at [Mixedbread AI](https://mixedbread.ai).

Either set the `MXBAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your Mixedbread AI API key, or pass it as the `apiKey` option to the constructor of the class you are using.

## Embeddings

This package provides access to the different embedding models provided by the Mixedbread AI API, such as the "mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1" model.

```typescript
const embeddings = new MixedbreadAIEmbeddings({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });
const texts = ["Baking bread is fun", "I love baking"];
const result = await embeddings.embedDocuments(texts);
console.log(result);
```

## Reranking

This package provides access to the reranking API provided by Mixedbread AI. It allows you to rerank a list of documents based on a query. Available models include "mixedbread-ai/mxbai-rerank-large-v1".
