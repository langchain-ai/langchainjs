This requires information from the `user` and `usergroup` resources.\n2.  **Get resource schemas:** I need to understand the structure of the `user` and `usergroup` resources, especially how they relate to each other. I'll use the `get_resource_schema` tool to get the schemas.\n3.  **Explore relationships:** I'll examine the schemas to find the field that links users to user groups. This will likely be a foreign key relationship.\n4.  **Fetch data:** I'll use the `perform_term_analysis` tool to count the number of users in each group.\n5.  **Prepare the response:** I'll format the data into a table showing the user group and the number of users in that group.\n\nNow, let's get the schemas.\n\n"
