## Summary

Bumps the `openai` SDK dependency from `^6.16.0` to `^6.18.0` and adds support for new API features introduced in v6.17.0 and v6.18.0.

## Changes

- **Bump `openai` to `^6.18.0`** — picks up abort signal memory leak fix, new image generation options, and updated types
- **Image generation `action` field** — new `action` option (`generate`, `edit`, `auto`) on the image generation tool, and removed a `@ts-expect-error` now that `gpt-image-1.5` is in the SDK types
- **Auto-route codex models to Responses API** — `_modelPrefersResponsesAPI` now returns `true` for codex models (`codex-mini-latest`, `gpt-5-codex`, `gpt-5.1-codex`, etc.) which are Responses API-only
- **Shell/local shell streaming support** — added `shell_call` and `local_shell_call` to the streaming converter's recognized output types and to `fallthroughCallTypes` for multi-turn input reconstruction
- **Tests** — added unit tests for `isReasoningModel`, `_modelPrefersResponsesAPI`, and image generation `action` field
