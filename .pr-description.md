## Summary

Bumps the OpenAI SDK dependency to `^6.24.0` to pick up support for expanded file input types (docx, pptx, csv, xlsx, and more) in the Responses API, as well as the new `gpt-5.3-codex` model.

## Changes

### @langchain/openai

- **SDK bump**: `openai` `^6.22.0` → `^6.24.0`. The new SDK versions include support for expanded file input types and the `gpt-5.3-codex` model.

- **Type fix for `ChatCompletionTool` union**: The SDK changed `ChatCompletionTool` from a single interface to a union of `ChatCompletionFunctionTool | ChatCompletionCustomTool`. Narrowed `_convertToOpenAITool` in `src/utils/tools.ts` to use `ChatCompletionFunctionTool` since it only ever produces function-type tools.

- **File input test coverage**: Added parameterized tests covering the four newly-supported document types (docx, pptx, xlsx, csv) across all three input methods (base64 data, URL, file ID) to verify the converter handles them correctly.
